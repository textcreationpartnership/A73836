            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the eighth &amp; ninth verſes of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſet down a gracious promiſe of God, made vnto the church, which ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150583:6"/>be in the time of the Goſpell (for that is meant by the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>) Which promiſe is this, that hee that is feeble among them: that is, the weakeſt Chriſtian that made conſcience of his waies, &amp; of the meanes of his ſaluation, in that day ſhould be as <hi>Dauid:</hi> that is, equal to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the time of the law in ſundry reſpects: and the houſe of <hi>Dauid:</hi> that is, the excellenter ſort of Chriſtians, ſhould bee as Gods houſe, and as the Angell of the Lord before them. The Prophet could not find any holie man, with whom hee might filly compare them, and therefore he ſaith, that they ſhould be like the Angel of the couenant Chriſt Ieſus, which went before the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe to guide and gouerne them.</p>
                  <p>Then hee goeth on and telleth vs, that after the Lord hath ſhewed this mercy vnto his Church, <hi>He will ſeeke to destroy all nations that come againſt</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; that is, all the enemies that doe oppoſe themſelues vnto his people, and endeauour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his good worke in them, and for them. Now when it is ſaid that <hi>hee will ſeeke to deſtroy them,</hi> the meaning is, that as hee hath a reſolution to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, ſo he will prouide meanes whereby it ſhall be effected.</p>
                  <p>Then further in the tenth verſe he ſetteth downe the meanes how his people would bee brought to ſuch excellencie. <hi>I wil poure vpon the houſe of</hi> Dauid, <hi>and vpon the inhabitants of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of grace, &amp;c.</hi> Signifying that he would vouchſafe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church vnder the Goſpell a more plentifull
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150583:6"/>meaſure of his Spirit, that as, they ſhould haue more excellent, and cleere, and powerfull meanes; ſo they ſhould find a greater bleſſing vpon the vſe of thoſe meanes; that whereas vnder the law, they had but drops of grace, diſtilling eaſily and by little and little, now they ſhould haue whole buckets full, as it were; yea whole flouds of grace poured downe vpon all ſorts of Gods ſeruants. By the <hi>Spirit of grace,</hi> is meant the Spirit of adoption, and of regeneration; ſo called, both becauſe it is giuen out of Gods free grace and fauour, as alſo becauſe it worketh grace and goodneſſe in all ſuch as are endued therewith: this Spirit is further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by a ſpeciall effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a Spirit <hi>of prayers.</hi> Till ſuch time as men are made partakers hereof, they may vſe many words of prayer, but they are altogether idle and vaine; fruites of their fleſh, and not of their faith; ſuch as they haue great cauſe to be humbled for, and no reaſon at all to be comforted in: but when once they haue this Spirit put into their hearts, they can call vpon the Lord in an acceptable and comfortable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Then next is ſhewed whither this Spirit leadeth them; to wit, vnto Chriſt. <hi>They ſhall looke on him, whom they haue pierced.</hi> When men begin to pray in a religious and conſcionable manner, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all fleſhly helps and hopes, &amp; betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto their Sauiour, whom they haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by their ſinnes; for it cannot properly be ſaid, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes,</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi> or the high
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150583:7"/>Prieſts, or the <hi>Romanes,</hi> did put Chriſt to death-they being but inſtruments thereof; but the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of Gods elect did the fact, and they were indeed the true and principall cauſe, that brought vpon the Sonne of God all manner of affliction, and perſecution, and execution it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place it is ſaid, that when his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall looke vpon him, <hi>They ſhall lament for him, or ouer him, or concerning him:</hi> (all comes to one rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.) As ſoone as they ſee what euils, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they haue brought vpon Chriſt Ieſus, by their tranſgreſſions, and how odious their offences are, which could be healed by no other medicine, but by the precious bloud of the immaculate Iambe of God: the due conſideration hereof will cauſe them to bee troubled and grieued at the very heart. Which griefe is ſet out, by two ſpeciall circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to wit, by the greatneſſe of it, and by the truth of it. The greatneſſe thereof is declared by two compariſons, which yet are inferiour and leſſe then the thing it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt compariſon, it is ſaid, <hi>That they ſhould lament for him, as one that mourneth for his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne, and be ſorry, as one is ſorry for his firſt borne.</hi> If parents haue many children, yet it will much grieue them to part with any of them: but if they haue but one onely ſonne, who is likely to be the heire of the family, and they loſe him, and ſo are diſappointed of their hope, then they vſually mourne with an exceeding bitter lamentation, as the woman of the cittie of <hi>Nain</hi> did for the death
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150583:7"/>of her onely ſon. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.11. Such (the holy Ghoſt ſaith) ſhall be the ſorrow of all true penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when they apprehend the multitude and grieuouſneſſe of their ſinnes, whereby they haue ſlaine the Lord of life.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond compariſon, here vſed to expreſſe the meaſure of their ſorrow, is taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who when their godly &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy king <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was ſlaine in the valley of <hi>Megiddo</hi> neere <hi>Hadadrimmon,</hi> in fighting againſt <hi>Pharoah Necho,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Chron. 35.</note> they lamented for him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitterly: and not onely the common people who haue not ſo good a gouernment of their affections, mourned for him, but <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the Prophet alſo, and others of the beſt ſort of men and women, tooke this loſſe exceedingly to heart, as ſeeing in the death of <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> the death and ruine both of Church and common wealth. In which regard it was ſet downe as an ordinance, that they ſhould haue ſet times of mourning, for that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which befell them through his death; and ſuch (ſaith the Prophet) ſhall be the lamentation of thoſe that attaine to the ſight and ſenſe of their ſinnes, whereby they haue ſlaine the Lord Chriſt Ieſus. verſe 11.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus ſet forth the greatneſſe of their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he commeth in the next place to expreſſe the ſoundneſſe thereof: <hi>The land ſhall bewaile euery fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily apart, &amp;c.</hi> Not in the publicke aſſemblies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, where the teares of one may draw on the teares of another, and ſo their mourning be either
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150583:8"/>naturall for company, or hypocritall for vaine glory: but he ſaith, that euery family ſhould weepe apart, and in priuate; yea not onely the ſeuerall families, but particular perſons, yea thoſe that were moſt neerely lincked together, <hi>viz.</hi> the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the wife, ſhould bee ſeparated in this worke of humiliation, and not content themſelues to pray and bewaile their ſinnes one with another, but take ſome time each of them to performe this dutie in ſecret; and if they that are ſo inward one with another ſhould lament apart, much more others, that are further off one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>By the houſe of <hi>Dauid</hi> is meant (as was before ſhewed) the excellenter ſort of Chriſtians; and the like is ſignified by the houſe of <hi>Nathan,</hi> who was the ſon of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of whom Chriſt came: (for the family of <hi>Salomon</hi> was wholy extinguiſhed.) By the houſe of <hi>Leui,</hi> is meant the ordinary ſort of the <hi>Leuites;</hi> and as for the family of <hi>Shimei,</hi> it was one of the principall families of <hi>Leui.</hi> Whence we may obſerue, that all families without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are tyed to this worke, and ought iointly and ſeuerally to performe the ſame. None are ſo good but they muſt weepe for their ſinnes in ſecret, and pray for the continuance &amp; increaſe of their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and as it is not needleſſe for the beſt, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it bootleſſe for the meaneſt, but whoſoeuer doth ſo, ſhall haue a fountaine of grace opened vnto him, whereby all his iniquities ſhall be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away.</p>

                  <p> The drift then of theſe words (wee ſee) is, to manifeſt and expreſſe the great goodneſſe of God towards his ſeruants, in the time of the Goſpell; and here is ſhewed,

                  <p>This point is euident in the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>

                  <p>Againe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is ſaid in the ſelfe ſame place, <hi>That where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is libertie, Verſ.</hi> 17. Till ſuch time as that doth ſet men free, they are held faſt in the cordes and chaines of iniquity, and are miſerable ſlaues vnto the vileſt ſlaue that is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto Satan himſelfe (who is an Apoſtata, and a reprobate,) and in the moſt wretched ſlauerie that can be imagined, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſerue ſin in the luſts thereof; and (which is the moſt grieuous of all the reſt) they ſhall haue the worſt wages that may be, euen the curſe and vengeance of God, while they liue, and eternall damnation of body and ſoule af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are dead. Now when the Spirit of Chriſt taketh poſſeſſion of vs, it cauſeth vs to diſclaime the ſeruice of Satan, and to become ſeruants vnto the liuing God;
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> it filleth vs full of good meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of holy deſires, and ſpirituall affections; it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth vs with ability to performe the duties of religion, &amp; of our callings; &amp; in a word, it maketh vs willing and able both to do all maner of good, and to reſiſt all manner of euill. So that after wee haue receiued the holy Ghoſt into our hearts, we ſhall not ſay: This is my nature, and I cannot doe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150583:11"/>otherwiſe: but with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul; I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth mee:</hi> I wil neuer bee in bondage vnto my corruptions any more; for grace ſhall haue the vpper hand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Spirit ſhall maſter the fleſh, and get the better of it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is added in the ſame place,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Spirit wee ſee the glory of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and are changed into his image, from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory; that is, from one meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and holineſſe into another. <hi>verſe</hi> 16. Wee would thinke no price too great to be giuen for ſuch a looking glaſſe, as would make one that is deformed to become beautifull by the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding thereof: how much then ſhould wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme the holy word of God, which (through the operation of the Spirit) is made effectuall, not to change the naturall viſage (which is a ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) but to alter the forme and ſhape of the ſoule, and to make it very beautifull and amiable in the ſight of God and of his holy Angels, which was before time a moſt vgly and deformed creature? This muſt needs be a maruellous great benefit; for if the defacing of Gods Image be the cauſe of all our woe, then the repairing thereof muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie be the cauſe of all our happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>A fifth reaſon why their ſtate is ſo happy that are endued with Gods ſpirit, is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> becauſe that is it which comforteth and ſtrengtheneth them in all their temptations and troubles. Thoſe that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of this holy comforter, when aduerſity ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150583:12"/>vpon them, do either fret or faint; either fall to murmuring, or to deſperation: but thoſe that haue their hearts repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, doe then moſt ſtrongly reioice, when tribulations and miſeries lye moſt heauily vpon them: as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles when they were moſt grieuouſly perſecuted, are ſaid then <hi>to be filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 4.31.</note> And what of that?
<note place="margin">Acts 5.41.</note> Then <hi>they reioyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer rebuke for Chriſt his name.</hi> And as <hi>Pauls ſufferings did abound,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.5.</note> ſo did his conſolations in Chriſt abound alſo.</hi> So that when comfort is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort indeed, and when life it ſelfe would go vnleſſe comfort came, then doth the holy Ghoſt moſt plenteouſly refreſh the heart with inward ioy and contentment:
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.6.8.</note> according to that ſaying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter; Now for a ſeaſon yee are in heauineſſe, and yet reioyce with ioy vnſpeakable and glorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto the reaſons alleaged haue tended chiefely to his, euen to ſhew what good the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace bringeth vnto our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Now further,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> there is a ſixth reaſon for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this point, which is, that it doth alſo make vs exceeding profitable vnto others; which is a very great addition vnto our bleſſednes. Al the wit, &amp; learning, and art in the world, cannot make a man to bee a conſtant and conſcionable doer of good, but Gods ſpirit alone muſt doe that: and therfore goodneſſe is ſet downe as a fruit thereof. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. And in the ſixth chapter of that Epiſtle, ver. 1. the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>If any man be ouertaken by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offence; ye that are ſpirituall reſtore ſuch a one,</hi> not ye
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150583:12"/>that are wittie or learned, &amp;c. For no man can be a good Phyſitian vnto others, but he that hath firſt wrought a cure vpon his owne ſoule; in which regard the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith:
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.4.</note> 
                     <hi>We are able to comfort others with the conſolations wherewith wee our ſelues haue been comforted.</hi> Looke then who is moſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and wee ſhall find that he doth alwaies moſt good. Therefore was it, that when the Apoſtles were to conuert the whole world, and to batter downe hell gates vpon Satans head, they had the Spirit plentifullie poured downe vpon them;

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> here are thoſe much more ſharply to be rebuked, who thinke it beſt not to be led by the Spirit, but rather by the luſts of the fleſh, and the luſts of the eyes; imagining in their folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that if they can heape together a great deale of wealth, and aduance themſelues and theirs to great places in the world, then they ſhall be happy men, and leade a merry and cheerefull life: albeit they neuer take any care, nor vſe any endeuour to get the ſpirit of grace into their hearts, but rather think them to be out of their wits that labor to be ſpiritual. Wil theſe men know what their eſtate is? the Apoſtle telleth them:
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man haue not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is not his:</hi> and if hee bee not his,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.</note> he is for the preſent, a bondſlaue of Satan, and in the ſtate of a reprobate; and if ſuch can bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py men, then are they happy, otherwiſe not. If it were poſſible that for their outward condition of life they could be equal vnto <hi>Adam</hi> in paradiſe, yet muſt they needs be very miſerable as he was, when the ſpirit of God was taken from him; it was not the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Eden</hi> that could then yeeld him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, but he was in farre greater miſerie and perplexity in that place then many theeues are in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150583:13"/>the dungeon, or vpon the gallowes, when they are ready to be turned ouer. He that hath the ſpirit of God as <hi>Paul</hi> had, ſhall find a heauen in priſon, in ſickneſſe, in death it ſelfe: whereas he that hath it not, ſhall find a hell, though he liued in as good a place as the very paradiſe of God was.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is an vſe of inſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that wee ſhould ſearch and try whether wee haue the Spirit or not: for it is not a matter of ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but ſuch as neerely concerneth vs.</p>
                  <p>If then we would be reſolued of this point,
<note place="margin">How we may diſcerne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue the ſpirit or not. Gal. 5.17.</note> let vs firſt examine, whether there be in vs that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warre and conflict (mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fleſh and the Spirit, which al godly men do find and feele in themſelues more or leſſe: for as the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh, <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh.</hi> Now this combat is generall throughout all the powers and faculties of the ſoule, as (to giue inſtance in the chiefe of them:) Firſt, in the vnderſtanding part, there is a conflict betweene carnall reaſon, and the iudgement rightly informed by Gods word; as in this particular: A good man is railed vpon, and vndeſeruedlie traduced, and vilified; in this caſe reaſon will thus play its part: Why ſhould you beare it at his hand, are not you his better? haue you not him at an aduantage? Why ſhould you not take him downe, and giue him as good as he brings? Nay (ſaith the Spirit) you muſt not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euill for euill,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12. Matth. 5.</note> but rather <hi>ouercome euill with goodneſſe, and bleſſe them that curſe you, and pray for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150583:14"/>ſuch as hate you and perſecute you</hi> in word or deede: they haue too much fire in them already, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not you adde more fuel thereunto, leſt the flame be redoubled; but rather caſt water vpon it, that it may be extinguiſhed. Thus doth the Spirit bring the weapons of God to ſubdue the fleſh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the fleſh doth come armed with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the Diuel to reſiſt the Spirit. Indeed there is many tiems in vnregenerate perſons, a fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt carnall reaſon and their naturall conſcience; but that is not generall throughout all the powers of the ſoule, neither doth it extend it ſelfe vnto the motions and inclinations that are euill, to curbe and repreſſe them; nor breede humilitie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of ſpirit, in the parties in whom it is found, and ſo driue them to the Lord to craue aide and ſtrength from him to ſubdue their corruptions: but theſe checks of the naturall conſcience do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make men more fierce and froward, and at length more violent and outragious in ſinning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if they haue been occaſioned either by the hearing of the terible curſe of the law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them in the publicke miniſtery; or by the faithfull dealing of ſome Chriſtian friend, which hath throughly applied the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the word vnto their drowſie conſciences, wherewith they were moued for the time, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards returne to their vomit again: then (I ſay) they will be much more boiſterous in their ſinfull courſes then euer they were before.</p>
                  <p>And as there is a conflict in the vnderſtanding
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150583:14"/>part, ſo is there the like in the affections: for the fleſh is ready to draw them vnto pride and enuie, and vncleannes, and couetouſnes, &amp;c. But the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtirreth and moueth them vnto better things, ſhewing withall that thoſe forenamed vices will harden the hart, make it vnfit for prayer, or thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, or any ſuch ſpirituall exerciſe; and in the end will bring many bitter troubles and afflictions vpon thoſe that let them to haue ſway and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in their ſoules: all which euil inconueniences we ſhall eſcape, if our affections bee heauenly and ſpirituall, and ſet on their right obiects.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe in the will this fight will appeare, whereſoeuer true ſanctification is begun. For the fleſh will be vnwilling to pray, to heare, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, to conferre; &amp; in a word, as any duty tendeth more to the crucifying of the luſts thereof, ſo will it be more auerſe therefrom, and more prone to delay and to put off the performance thereof. But the regenerate part is contrarilie diſpoſed, and chearfully embraceth that which is good, though it be clogged and hindred in the performance of the ſame: ſetting downe this for a certaine truth, that the more painefull any ſeruice is, the more gainefull it is; that though we begin our prayers in heauineſſe, yet wee may end in gladneſſe; that the more vntractable and vntoward the fleſh is, the more glorious our conqueſt is, if we can get the maiſtery of it, and bring it into Gods preſence; and that if we cannot do as well as we would, yet if we do as well as we can, we ſhal be accepted and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <p>And laſtly for the memory, before their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Gods owne children are prone to remember iniuries and vnkindnes, which others haue offered vnto them, and to forget ſuch as they haue offered vnto others; they can hold faſt all ſuch things as will further corrupt them, but they let ſlip whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer may benefit and helpe then in good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courſes: but after their regeneration the caſe is altered with them: for them they ſtriue to disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their memories of all things that may hurt them, and to retaine onely ſuch matters as may make them more humble, and mercifull, and thankfull. This ſpiritual fight in the inward man is a moſt infallible mark of the ſpirit of grace, which is the rather to bee noted, becauſe many of Gods ſeruants through ignorance take it to bee quite contrary. We find (ſay they) ſuch a deale of carnall reaſon, ſo many ſinfull affections and luſts, &amp; ſuch vnwillingnes and vnfitneſſe for euery holy dutie, that we much doubt whether we haue Gods ſpirit in vs or not. But who tels you that there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things amiſſe in you? who is it that cauſeth you to ſee the errors of your mind, and the corruptions of your heart? who is it that cauſeth you to hate them, and to bee out of liking with your ſelfe for them? who is it that enableth you to take Gods part againſt them, and to ſtriue by all meanes to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150583:16"/>be freed from the bondage of them? Is it not the ſpirit of God that worketh al theſe good things in you? and why then ſhould you make queſtion whether it dwell in you yea or no: theſe are fruits of the Spirit, which are neuer found in any but in ſpirituall men.</p>
                  <p>And if any deſire yet a further triall, let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether there bee in him thoſe other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Spirit which are recited <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150583:17"/>and earneſtly to long for it: for the Lord ſaith in the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah:

Now if you that are ſinfull can paſſe by the infirmities of your children, and giue them ſuch things as are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though you haue made them no promiſe; and you cannot relieue them without coſt and paines vnto your ſelues, nay many times not without pinching your ſelues, and ſparing from your owne backs and bellies: if you (I ſay) that are euill can deale thus louingly and kindly with your children, how much more wil your heauenly father, who is the God of all goodnes, yea goodnes it ſelfe, deale fauourably with his children, hauing made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vnto them, &amp; it being no paines nor charges vnto him, to beſtow a plentifull meaſure of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces vpon them? and eſpecially ſeeing that the more liberall hee is that way vnto them, the more glory ſhall thereby redound vnto his great name.

Bring ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſtrong reaſons to adulterers, or gameſters, or Sabbath-breakers, or any that liue in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all practiſe of ſuch dangerous and damnable ſins, and preſſe them neuer ſo forcibly to cauſe them to forſake their leaud and wretched courſes; and yet can they not ſee why they ſhould leaue them, but rather imagine that they may lawfully follow the ſame ſtill. And no maruell: for till the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen do ſet downe their carnall reaſon, it can neuer be ſet downe; and till he ſtop their mouthes, they will neuer be ſilenced, but ſtill haue ſomewhat to ſay for their wretched and vile behauiour.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then it is euident,
<note place="margin">Reaſons colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the former places.</note> that Gods Spirit alone can perſwade vs of the loue and fauor of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father towards vs, that ſo we may be in caſe to pray vnto him: and withal muſt furniſh vs with the matter, and helpe vs in the manner of our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and humble vs in the ſight of our owne miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wants, that ſo we may bee more earneſt and feruent in the requeſts that wee make: the point now in hand, may hence bee ſtrongly concluded; to wit, that none can make a faithfull prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpeciall aide and direction of the holy Ghoſt: which ſerueth,</p>
                  <p>Firſt for the confutation of thoſe ſenſeleſſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that will bee talking and bragging how they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150583:20"/>pray day and night. They that know what it is to lift vp a feruent prayer vnto the heauens, doe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcerne that they are but meere braggers and boaſters, and that indeede they neuer made one faithful praier ſince they were borne, becauſe they are, and ſtill haue been ſenſuall and carnall, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void of any ſanctifying grace of Gods ſpirit: and therefore ſo farre are they from hauing any cauſe of reioycing in regard of their good prayers (as they cal them) that they haue great cauſe to be humbled for them, as being workes of the fleſh, and not of the Spirit, ſuch as doe rather prouoke the Lords diſpleaſure againſt them, then pacifie his anger, or any way procure his fauour towards them.</p>
                  <p>Such are the prayers of all blind and ignorant Papiſts, who pray in an vnknowne tong, to whom it may bee ſaid, as it was by our Sauiour vnto the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus, Ye know not what ye ask.</hi> They may ſpeake what they liſt of their often praying, and how readily they can go through with their ſtint and taske: but they that vnderſtand what it is to bring God and their owne ſoules together in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſts, and feruent ſupplications, cannot but iudge them to bee bragging Phariſees, who thinke that the Lord is beholding vnto them, and indebted vnto them for ſuch prayers; whereas in truth he may iuſtly condemne them vnto hell for the ſame, and wil do ſo, if they be not humbled for them, as well as for the reſt of their iniquities. And therfore they that haue indeed the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150583:21"/>are of another mind: for when they haue vſed the beſt preparation that poſſibly they can, they find ſo many defects in their prayers, that they are driuen to make a new prayer for the pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe their wants, and are ſtirred vp hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to praiſe the Lord, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can in any poore meaſure powre out their ſoules before him, as knowing, that it is not from any ſtrength that they haue in themſelues, but from the help and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his good Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let this be an inſtruction vnto vs, that if wee would pray aright, and ſpeed accordingly, wee labour (as <hi>Iude</hi> exhorteth) <hi>to pray in the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iude verſ. 20.</note> For thoſe be the petitions that pierce the heauens, and bring peace and comfort vnto the conſcience. But how ſhall we know, whether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur prayers proceed from Gods Spirit or not? for our ſinfull hearts are apt to deceiue vs on both ſides: <hi>viz.</hi> either to make vs thinke (through Satans ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion) that wee doe not pray in the holy Ghoſt, becauſe we haue ſo many frailties, when in truth we doe; or that we pray as wee ought to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue matter and words at will, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no ſuch thing, but onely a naturall gift of vttering that which is in our mindes and memories, in apt and fit tearmes, and in a fluent manner of ſpeech. Therefore if wee would know, what it is to pray in the holy Ghoſt, it is this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Rules for prayer.</note> wee muſt haue a warrant for the things that wee aske,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and that from the word of God,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150583:21"/>where the Lords will is reuealed,
<note place="margin">1. Iohn 5.14.</note> according wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all our petitions muſt be framed. In which regard we muſt acquaint our ſelues with the holy Scriptures, and often exerciſe our hearts in the meditation thereof. That is, as it were, the wood, whence wee muſt fetch timber for this building: and the mine, out of which wee may take many golden arguments to bring before the Lord in our prayers, which hee cannot deny becauſe they are his owne hand writing, whereby hee doth grant vs liberty to aske, and aſſurance to obtaine al need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things. So that ſpirituall graces wee may aske ſimply without any exception, or limitation: and for outward bleſſings, we may craue them ſo farre as they may bee good for vs: and for croſſes wee may lawfully deſire either to haue them kept from vs, or ſanctified vnto vs, ſo that we may haue ſtrength and patience to beare them, and grace and wiſedome to make a right vſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> we muſt be touched with an inward longing, and earneſt deſire of the things which we aske; for it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Rom 8.26.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Spirit maketh requeſt for vs [with ſighes] which cannot be expreſſed.</hi> As we ſee in <hi>Hannah,</hi> who came with a heart full of heauenlie meditations and of holy deſires, which ſhee did not expreſſe in words, but made them knowne vnto the Lord, with whom her heart was labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time of her prayer. Now if we would obtaine this inward affection, wee muſt ponder much on Gods goodneſſe and readines to heare, and to helpe vs; and of our owne miſerable wants,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150583:22"/>which moue vs to become ſuiters vnto his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: and then if we can get a good perſwaſion of God, and a due eſtimation of the things which we beg at his hands, we ſhall not chuſe but be inſtant and earneſt in our prayers; not taking vp the time in words of courſe, and in making vaine and idle repetitions, or drowſie and lumpiſh petitions, as if we cared not whether we loſt, or found; but wee ſhall bee able to crie feruently vnto the Lord, and then cannot he deny our requeſts.
<note place="margin">Pſ. 145.19. Iames 5.</note> 
                     <hi>For he heareth the cry of them that feare him, and fulfilleth their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and the prayer of the righteous auaileth much when it is feruent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> if we would haue this teſtimony vnto our ſoules that wee pray in the holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">See M. Dods Sermon on Iames 4.3.</note> then muſt wee propoſe a right end in our ſuits, not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any thing with an intent to ſpend it vpon our luſts, but with a purpoſe to vſe it vnto the glory of God, the furtherance of our owne ſaluation, and the good and comfort of mankind, eſpeciallie of ſuch as are of the houſhold of faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> we muſt beleeue that we ſhal obtaine that which we aske; according to that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour:
<note place="margin">Mar. 21.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Whatſoeuer ye deſire when yee pray, beleeue that ye ſhall haue it.</hi> Which faith of ours will bee vnto vs a ſure argument, that we pray in the Spirit, which ſtirreth vs vp to make ſuch requeſts alone, as it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth vs ſhall be performed. But by the way let vs obſerue, that ſometimes ſpirituall men may make carnall prayers, as <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> did, when they deſired that God would take
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150583:22"/>away their liues; which proceeded from the pride of the fleſh, and from the rebelliouſneſſe of their wils, in that they could not content themſelues to liue in that eſtate, wherunto the Lord had brought them. Such fleſhly petitions may wee ſometimes put vp before the Lord; but we ſhall haue checks and rebukes in our hearts for the ſame, and no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that they ſhall be granted: but when our ſuits are ſpirituall, the holy Ghoſt which moueth vs to aske, will alſo perſwade vs that God is able and willing to heare vs, and to relieue vs, and that therefore we ſhall obtaine a bleſſing ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therfore labour <hi>to aske in faith,</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Iames</hi> exhoreth) <hi>and not wauer:
<note place="margin">Iames 1.3.</note> for hee that wauereth,</hi> and maketh queſtion whether God will heare him or not, <hi>is like a waue of the ſea toſt with the wind, and carried away;</hi> being neuer at quiet in himſelfe, but ſometimes imagining that the Lord wil helpe him, he runneth vnto him; and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a conceit that ſuch and ſuch men will doe ſomewhat for him, hee leaueth prayer, and beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe vnto them: but finding no reliefe there, he will to prayer againe; and yet hauing not a preſent anſwer, nor faith to wait vpon the Lord, he fals to ſhift for himſelfe by vſing of ill meanes; and ſo is altogether vnſtable and vnſetled, euen as the waues of the ſea that are neuer at reſt; euerie vaine cogitation, &amp; euery ſlight tentation toſſing and turmoyling, and diſquieting his hart. Thus it ought not to be, neither will it be thus with thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150583:23"/>that aske in faith; for they know that they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and that it ſhall be vnto them according to their faith: that either they ſhall haue the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing that they aske, or a better in ſtead thereof: and therefore they pray ſtill, and waite Gods lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and herein they much honour the Lord, in that they caſt themſelues vpon the truth of his promiſe, and do not trouble their hearts with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary feares and cares about the ſucceſſe, which is Gods worke, and not theirs. Men will be glad to bee rid of importunate ſuiters, that they ſhould not be ſtil hanging vpon them, eſpecially if their ſuite bee weighty, and the things that they craue of ſome importance: But the Lord would in no caſe haue men to let their ſuits fall; nay he takes delight in ſuch as will not haue a repulſe, but ſtill depend vpon him, and daily renew their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for they ſhew euidently that they haue a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrong faith: they would not preſume to ask vnleſſe they had a warrant; and hauing a warrant, they dare not make queſtion of obtaining; for that were to make doubt of Gods truth and fidelity.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee what it is to <hi>pray in the holy Ghoſt, viz.</hi> to haue a good ground for that which wee aske: a good end, and a good affection in asking, and faith to beleeue, that we ſhal obtaine whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we aske in ſuch a maner.</p>
                  <p>A third vſe of this point,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> is for a ſingular conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſuch as can pray in that ſort: howſoeuer the Diuell would perſwade them that they haue not the ſanctifying Spirit of God in them, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150583:23"/>onely ſuch flaſhings as hypocrites ſometimes haue; yet hereby they may be aſſured that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt dwelleth in them indeede, becauſe they conſtantlie powre out ſtrong cries, and faithfull ſupplications before the Lord, which no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite can doe:
<note place="margin">Iob 27.10.</note> for (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>He cannot ſet his delight on the almightie, nor call vpon God at all times.</hi> For that is a ſpeciall gift of God, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar vnto the Saints; and as any one maketh more ſuch holy praiers, ſo may he be more confidentlie perſwaded, that hee hath the Spirit of grace in a greater meaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[And they ſhall looke vpon mee whom they haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced]</hi> that is, vpon Chriſt, and that by the eye of faith, ſetting their heart and hope on him, and through him expect to bee heard and relieued: whence obſerue this doctrine, that the Spirit of prayer doth alwaies leade men vnto Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
                  <p>It cauſeth them wholly to go out of themſelues,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> and to offer vp their ſupplications in,
<note place="margin">The Spirit of prayer doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies direct men vnto Chriſt Ieſus.</note> and through their Sauiour and Redeemer. This was figured in the ſacrifices that were offered vnder the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law; at which time if any one were polluted by any occaſion, or otherwiſe clogged with ſins that hee had committed, he was to bring his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto the Prieſt, and was to be ſprinckled with the bloud thereof; which did ſignifie the bloud of Chriſt, by which all Gods elect were to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and a reconciliation betwixt God and them was to be procured. For this cauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> though
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150583:24"/>hee were a man much beloued of God, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit of prayer in a wonderfull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet hee deſireth the Lord to heare him, not for his ſake,
<note place="margin">Daniel 9.17.</note> or for his peoples ſake, but for the Lord Chriſt Ieſus his ſake. Therfore doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour tell his diſciples,
<note place="margin">Iohn 16.23.</note> that <hi>whatſoeuer they ſhould aske the Father [in his name] hee would giue it vnto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why the Spirit of grace doth alwaies direct vs vnto Chriſt in our prayers,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                     </label> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it maketh vs ſee our owne vileneſſe and wretchedneſſe, and ſo conſequently that we ſtand in need of the mediation of Chriſt Ieſus. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the couenant of grace, after Gods people haue receiued the holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">Ezech. 36.31.</note> it is ſaid: <hi>Then ſhall ye remember your owne wicked waies, and your deedes that were not good: and ſhall iudge your ſelues worthie to haue been deſtroyed for your iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> This is the firſt worke of the Spirit, euen to ſet them downe, that they ſhould haue nothing to ſay for themſelues, but plainely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſhame and confuſion, that deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and eternall condemnation is due vnto them, if the Lord ſhould enter into iudgement with them. Now when they are thus abaſed and humbled in themſelues, then will they ſeeke to haue a part in Chriſt his merits; that ſo both they, and their ſeruices may bee accepted of the Lord through his righteouſneſſe, and through his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, which hee doth continuallie make for them: which ſerueth,</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:150583:24"/>
                  <p> Firſt for the confutation of the Papiſts,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and to ſhew that they are not led by the Spirit, becauſe in their prayers they reſt not vpon the mediation, and interceſſion of Ieſus Chriſt, but ioyne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto their owne merits, and the merites of the Saints, thinking by that meanes to preuaile in their ſuites, and to obtaine their hearts deſire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it maketh alſo for the confutation of a number of ignorant men and women among vs, that will bragge of their daily ſtint of prayers which they runne ouer, and how they make no doubt but the Lord will accept of their requeſts, and will grant the ſame: and why? becauſe they liue honeſtlie among their neighbours, and doe no bodie any harme; and they hope withall that their good words and prayers doe deſerue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at Gods hands. Alas poore ſimple people, they little conſider what it is to make a good prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for if they did, they would goe quite out of themſelues vnto Chriſt Ieſus, and labour for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance onely for his ſake. And as for theſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which they ſo much ſtand vpon, if euer it pleaſe the Lord to open their eyes, and to waken their drowſie conſciences, they will be ſo far from thinking that they merite any thing thereby, as that they will ſee great cauſe to be humbled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for that they haue dealt ſo hypocritically and carnally, drawing neere vnto God with their lips, when their hearts haue been remooued farre from him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, here is another vſe of conſolation,

Put caſe that a man had one onely ſonne, which was to bee the heire of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and hee of a ſudden ſhould find him ſtarke dead, would it not inwardly touch him, and ſtrike cold vnto his heart? eſpecially if he himſelfe had vnwittingly been the cauſe thereof? yes certainly, it would go through his heart euen like a ſword: and ſuch will be the griefe of thoſe who through their tranſgreſſions haue ſlaine their bleſſed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as this very text witneſſeth, when they by the eye of faith doe ſee him heauy vnto the death, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto his Father in the bitterneſſe of his griefe; being ful of torment in his bodie, and fuller of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in his ſoule, and that for their ſakes, euen for their ſinnes, they cannot but be exceedingly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hereat. And a little to preſſe the other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150583:27"/>vſed in this text, if the people of God did ſo bewaile the death of their worthy king <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> who yet died vnwillingly, and without any intent to benefit them thereby: how much more bitterlie ſhould wee lament the death of our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who was a farre greater and excellenter king then <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was, and yet willingly and freely laid downe his life for our ſakes, that he might free vs from eternall death, and deſtruction both of our bodies and ſoules? Queſtionleſſe if wee haue any ſpirituall life and ſenſe in vs, this will make vs loath our ſinnes, that brought our deare Sauiour ſo much woe and miſerie; and cauſe vs heartily to mourne for the ſame, euen as a man would do at the ſight of a knife, or ſword, or ſome ſuch like inſtrument, whereby at vnawares hee hath ſlaine his child, or wife, or any that was neere and deare vnto him. Eſpeciallie if wee conſider; that God out of his meere loue gaue his onelie Sonne vnto vs, when we deſerued nothing at his hands, but his heauie curſe and vengeance to be executed vpon vs:
<note place="margin">Iohn 3.14.</note> and that the Son of God was content from the aboundance of his loue, to bee ſo abaſed and vilified, ſo afflicted, and tormented, for our offences; this muſt needes worke vpon our ſoules, if wee haue but the leaſt drop of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in vs.</p>

                  <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe ſinne is the matter of all our woe and ſmart: it is that which doth vs moſt hurt,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 59.2.</note> and that which keepeth from vs all manner of good: and haue we not iuſt cauſe then to grieue that we ſhould lodge ſuch a gueſt in our ſoules? eſpecially if we conſider how beneficiall this holy griefe wil be vnto vs? for</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it wil be a means to make vs pure in Gods account, and ſo to free vs from the guilt of ſinne,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150583:30"/>2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and alſo <hi>to purge our hearts and hands</hi> from the corruption thereof, ſo that we ſhall not bee in bondage thereunto any longer. <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.8. And hence it will come to paſſe, that either croſſes ſhal not at all light vpon vs, or at leaſt they ſhall not be burdenſome vnto vs. If wee keepe an Aſſiſes at home in our owne ſoules, and find our ſelues guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<note place="margin">1.

And therefore when men are ſo vexed and diſquieted at iniuries and indignities, or any outward diſtreſſes, that they cannot eate, nor drinke, nor ſleepe, it is ſure that they haue little godly ſorrow, and ſtore of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow: for if that holy griefe did poſſeſſe their hearts, it would eate vp and conſume carnall vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſerpent did the ſerpents of the Aegyptian ſorcerers. And this euery godly man ſhall find in his owne experience, that looke what day, or houre ſoeuer hee hath wept moſt bitterlie for his offences againſt God, then hee eſteemeth croſſes to be moſt light and eaſie, and finds matter of thankfulneſſe in whatſoeuer grieuances befall him, as knowing it to be Gods goodneſſe that it is not worſe with him.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:150583:30"/>
                  <p> Here then are thoſe to bee reproued that will tell vs a long tale of their repentance,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> and of their ſorrow for ſinne; but what kinde of ſorrow hath it been? a ſhallow, and hollow, and ſleight ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that neuer made them to ſhed one teare in ſecret, nor to make one feruent prayer from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heart for the pardoning of their iniquities. Let them heare that one of their kine is dead, or one of their horſes ſtolne, or their barne on fire, or the like, and they will mourne in good earneſt at ſuch a caſualtie, and bee more mooued to heare that their goods are in danger to bee burnt, then that their ſoules are likely to burne in hell. This is a plaine argument that what ſhewes ſoeuer they make, yet they haue not trulie repented for their euill works: for if the holie Ghoſt had giuen them an inward touch for their ſinnes, they would grieue moſt for that which hurts them moſt; and not for thoſe things, the hauing whereof cannot much benefit them, nor the loſſe thereof prooue verie inconuenient vnto them. Yet ſo beaſtly are many, that if they be vrged to ſounder repentance, and greater reformation, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlie aske, What would you haue vs to doe more then wee doe alreadie? wee loue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, and our neighbours as our ſelues, and repent continuallie for our faults: What? would you haue vs ſo melancholie and penſiue as ſome are that vſe to runne to Sermons? nay, we will be aduiſed of that; for they are ſo grieued for their ſinnes, that they are almoſt driuen vnto deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

Miſerable men, little doe they know what ſound repentance meanes: for that is the thing which Gods Miniſters muſt aime at, euen to make men deſpaire in themſelues, that ſo they might reſt whollie vpon Chriſt Ieſus. And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is that Sermon, and happie that day which maketh men ſo to weepe ouer Chriſt Ieſus, as that they vtterly fall out with themſelues, and with their naughtie and prophane courſes: for this will beſt prooue vnto their ſoules, that they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Spirit of grace, and haue attained vnto true repentance.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150583:31"/>thereof, but endeuour to bewaile our ſinnes with a bitter lamentation. Such as is mentioned in this text, <hi>viz.</hi> that wee mourne as one would doe for the death of his firſt borne, and as the Iewes did for <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> when hee was ſlaine in the valley of <hi>Megiddo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But (will ſome ſay) if this bee required of all true Chriſtians,

                     </label> who can ſay that hee is ſuch an one? for few or none haue attained to ſuch deepe and piercing griefe.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is true for the moſt part,

                     </label> yet not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie: for ſome haue been as throughly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſorrow for their hainous tranſgreſſions, as any man hath bin for his childs death, or as they were for <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> death: and as for others that haue not been altogether ſo deepelie plunged in griefe and anguiſh, they take vp that in continuance, which they wanted in preſent paſſion. Naturall mourning is ordinarily more violent, as wee may obſerue in <hi>Dauids</hi> mourning for <hi>Abſolon,</hi> who cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the bitterneſſe of his heart, ſo that the people might heare him: but godly lamentation is more laſting and durable. So that the one may be well compared to a land floud, which maketh a great ſhew and noiſe for the time, but come a weeke after, and there will bee little appearance thereof: and the other, to wit godlie ſorrow, may be likened to a ſtill and conſtant raine, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth more deepely into the ground, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth longer, and doth more good a great deale, then a ſudden, violent, and tempeſtuous ſhower.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:150583:32"/>and herein let theſe be iudges, who are endued with the Spirit of God, and are acquainted with the waies of God; and let them ſpeake, who haue had the greateſt croſſes, and haue been euen drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with wormewood, as the Prophet ſpeaketh: let them (I ſay) ſpeake and teſtifie for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this point, whether many of their great troubles be not in a ſort forgotten, in regard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preſent griefe that they conceiue for them; and whether the ſinnes of their youth doe not more conſtantlie vexe and torment them, then all the afflictions of their youth doe. And if it be ſo, then may it well be concluded, that their ſorrow for ſin is greateſt, though it be notalwaies ſo boiſterous and bitter for the preſent: and therefore ſeeing it is a thing that may be attained vnto, let vs vſe all good meanes and helps whereby we may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered therein. See the meanes in that Sermon on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.</p>

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> godly men doe well conſider that thoſe that are moſt faithfull vnto God, will alſo ſhew themſelues moſt faithfull vnto them; they wil not infect their children, nor corrupt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor bee prodigall and waſtfull, nor blemiſh them and their families by raiſing vp ſlanders, and ſpreading abroad falſe reports and tales, tending to their reproach and diſgrace.

                  <p>Therfore it is to be noted, that in this place it is ſaid of husbands and wiues, that they ſhall lament [apart] euen they that are linked in the neareſt bonds, and might with moſt conueniencie lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their harts each before other; yet they ſhould not content themſelues with thoſe ſeruices which they performed together, vnleſſe God and their conſciences might ſomtimes meete in ſecret.

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:150583:34"/>
                  <p> Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe it wil be a witnes vnto our ſoules, that we do duties in truth, and not in hypocriſie: for in ſecret, albeit we ſhed teares aboundantly for our ſins, none can accuſe vs of vain-glory, neither will our owne hearts charge vs therewith: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in publicke there may be ſome ſuch. ſuſpicion in others, or doubt ariſing in our ſelues. And as our ſorrow wil thence appeare not to be hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, ſo will it alſo bee cleare vnto vs, that it is not naturall, nor for company, ſuch as may be in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill man, who ſeeing a great many weeping and mourning, can hardly refraine himſelfe from teares, but will bee apt and readie to lament with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is no man or woman but hath ſome ſinne or other, which is not meere for them to acknowledge before their neareſt friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch is the corruption of their nature, they will be ready to thinke the worſe of the party. The moſt louing and wiſe husband that is, if his wife ſhould diſcouer vnto him all her thoughts and ill affections, would entertaine ſomewhat a harder conceit of her then before he did; and therefore God would haue many ſinfull cogitations and motions laid open onely vnto himſelfe, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely mercifull and pittifull; and not vnto any creature in the world beſide.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine ſerueth for the iuſt reproofe of many profeſſonis,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> who are all in the Church, and nothing in the familie; or if they haue prayer and reading of the Scriptures twice a day publicke
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150583:34"/>with their whole family, they imagine that they haue gone as farre as they need to do; though they neuer throughout the whole week performe any ſeruice vnto the Lord in ſecret; neuer conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly meditate on the word; neuer earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile and confeſſe their hidden corruptions; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer feruently cry vnto the Lord for the ſauing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his holy Spirit; nor performe any ſuch duty apart, as all Chriſtians are bound to do. Such kind of perſons may aſſure themſelues, that their hearts are not right with God, and that they are not led by the Spirit of grace, which drawes thoſe in whom it reigneth, vnto the performance of good duties apart, as well as with companie: in their cloſets, in their chambers, in the fields, or in ſome ſuch priuate places or other, as well as in the Church, or with the whole ſocietie where they liue.</p>
                  <p>How much more are thoſe to be condemned who are ſo farre from ſeruing the Lord in ſecret, that they either refuſe to do it in publike, or if they affoord their bodily preſence, yet they are idle or profane, or wanton in their lookes, and in their geſtures, letting all that are neare them ſee the vile diſpoſition of their hearts, by their leaud and abominable carriage? Theſe ſinfull wretches are ſo farre from being excuſed by being at religious exerciſes, that they are much to bee condemned, for that in the land of righteouſneſſe (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh) they worke wickednes, and in the places where they ſhould ſhew al manner of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:150583:35"/>they expreſſe ſuch notable profanenes. Theſe are euen like <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was plotting to betray his maſter euen then, when he was at the Lords table to bee partaker of the holy Sacrament; and they ſhall ſpeede euen as hee did: for when affliction and miſery ſeazeth vpon them (as come it wil ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later, if they preuent it not by hearty repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) then ſhall they not bee able to ſtand before the Lord, nor before the face of their accuſing conſciences, but ſhall be ouerwhelmed with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and amazement, and be moreready to lay vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent hands on themſelues, then to ſeeke vnto the Lord for mercy, whom they haue ſo hainouſlie and preſumptuouſly offended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let vs hence learne to bee the ſame alone for matters of godlineſſe, as we are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and to do duties when no body ſees vs, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen becauſe God beholds vs) as well as when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyes are caſt vpon vs. This will be a teſtimonie vnto our ſoules of great ſincerity and vprightnes; and theſe priuate exerciſes of religion, wil maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly fit vs for the publike. And thence it comes to paſſe that many are ſo loth to appeare before God in the congregation, or in the family, and do feele the ſeruices of God ſo tedious and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, becauſe their hearts haue not been exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therewith in ſecret: for he that deales with his owne ſoule alone, ſhall find ſo many defects in himſelfe, that he will be very deſirous of the helpe of the Saints in publike aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Therfore let vs tie our ſelues euery day to ſpend
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150583:35"/>ſome time in meditating on the word, in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our harts, in hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling our ſelues for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces paſt &amp; preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; in praying to the Lord to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs where we are weake, to reſolue vs where we are in doubt, to ſhew vs our errours, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs in the right way: to let vs ſee our wants, and to ſupply them of his rich grace; let vs (I ſay) conſtantlie performe theſe and the like duties in ſecret, and then ſhall it bee plaine vnto our ſoules that wee are guided by Gods good Spirit. And howſoeuer the diuell will obiect that wee are not ſincere, becauſe we haue many times more in ſhew outwardly, then wee haue in ſubſtance inwardly; yet hereby ſhall we be able to approue the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our hearts: that albeit we haue not that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs which wee ſeeme to haue, yet wee deſire to haue it, and ſtriue to attaine to it; and he only is an hypocrite which neither hath, nor deſires to haue that which he maketh ſemblance to haue.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the words immediatly going before, is declared, how Chriſt rebuked thoſe that would call him, Lord, Lord, and make a profeſſion of religion, and yet not doe the things that he commanded them: for if they would ſpeake to their Lords, they muſt ſpeake to their luſts, for to them they are in ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Hauing beſtowed ſuch a reproofe vpon them, he leaueth them not ſo, but directeth them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150583:36"/>what they ſhould do, exhorting them to a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable practiſe of the word, to which that hee might more throughly perſwade them, hee vſeth two forcible reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 One is taken from the great commodity that will redoune vnto thoſe that doe practiſe it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they ſhall be inuincible againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and vnmoueable in all the ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts that ſhall ariſe. Verſ. 47.48.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another is taken from the great danger that will enſue vpon the contrary; which is this; that let men heare as much as they will, if they doe not yeeld obedience vnto it, they ſhall haue a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and feareful, and vnrecouerable fall: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they compared to an houſe that hath good ſtone and timber and workemanſhip beſtowed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, but it is built on an il foundation, on ſand, or on a quagmire, which is ſhaken by euery blaſt of winde, and if there ariſe any bluſtering ſtormes, is vtterly ouerthrowne.</p>
                  <p>Verſe 47. <hi>[Whoſoeuer commeth to me]</hi> In that Chriſt ſheweth that ſome haue recourſe vnto him, to heare his word, and are builders as well as others, (48) and yet are but diſſemblers,
<label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">Hypocrites in many things agree with Chriſtians.</note> the doctrine hence to bee learned is, that hypocrites may go as farre as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in many things.</p>
                  <p>They may come to Chriſt in the hearing of the word, in the receiuing of the ſacrament, in publike prayer, and yet bee falſe-hearted all the while. A true Chriſtian heares the pure word of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150583:37"/>mixture of popiſh or humane inuentions; ſo doth an hypocrite. A true Chriſtian is a builder, he edifies himſelfe in knowledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; ſo doth an hypocrite. <hi>Iudas</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi> can carry away many good leſſons; and yet the one go to hell for his falſhood and guile, when the other hath heauen for his portion, becauſe he had an vpright heart, and a ſpirit without guile. Thus farre wee ſee in the text wherein true Chriſtians and hypocrites doe agree: now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> what difference there is betwixt them. The one when he is to build, digges deepe, and caſts out the looſe earth, that ſo his foundation may bee firme and ſure: implying thus much, that the ſeruants of God know their hearts to bee hollow and falſe ground, and therefore when they haue heard a Sermon, they ſuſpect their owne guiltineſſe, and ſo ſearch their hearts, and lament their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for ſearching is digging, and lamenting is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting foorth of the rubbiſh and looſe earth. They thinke their labour euen loſt, vnleſſe their hearts can meete with ſuch a promiſe, with ſuch a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or with ſuch an inſtruction, to make a right vſe of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now on the other ſide, an hypocrite makes quicke work, all his building is aboue ground, and therefore when hee hath talked a little of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he is well, and thinkes all his worke is diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: he ſpends no time in digging and ſearching; nor in grieuing and lamenting for his corruptions: nay hee cenſureth Chriſtians as too melancholy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150583:37"/>and penſiue, that will goe aſide into a corner, and there deale by praiers and teares betwixt God and their owne hearts: what need all this adoe (ſaith the hypocrite) is not God mercifull? Hee is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet will he haue vs to be ſeuere and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full towards our corrupt and euill luſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtil to be digging at them, and caſting of them foorth of our hearts. And as in this place we may perceiue how farre true Chriſtians doe both agree and differ, ſo there are other Scriptures to cleare the ſame, as the eighth of <hi>Luke,</hi> the parable of the grounds, wherein it is euident, that the ſtonie ground did heare the word of God, and that with vnderſtanding, yea with ioy: nay which is more, the thorny ground did not only receiue the ſeed, but brought foorth both the blade and the eare, that is, did not onely with readineſſe receiue the word, but alſo did ſomewhat (in their manner) which the word commanded: thus farre the ill grounds agreed with the good ground. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the good ground went beyond them, that thoſe that were ſignified thereby, came with a good and honeſt heart, and had patience to vndergoe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for the truth, and contempt of the world, that they would not bee choaked with the cares and pleaſures therof: wheras the other ſort if they ſaw in likely hood, that they might get more profit and eaſe by following the world, then by cmbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſt, they were gone.</p>
                  <p>Another place fit for the proofe of this point,
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> we haue in the parable of the Virgins; where we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150583:38"/>may obſerue. 1. That they were all [Virgins] that is, ſuch as did profeſſe to ſeparate themſelues from worldly luſts, and did not go a whoring after the common corruptions of the times, but kept themſelues within the bounds of outward ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; as <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> for a time did, who could not be charged with groſſe couetouſnes or coſenage, or the like. 2. Further they had all [lampes] that is, an outward ſhew of good things. And (3.) [Oyle in their lampes] ſo much as could make a blaze to get them the credit of profeſſors: they could ſpeake well, and doe diuers works that were glorious in the view of the world. 4. They all went to meete the Bride-groome] that is, all of them frequented the means of ſaluation, as if they expected fauor and fellowſhip with Chriſt Ieſus. 5. Laſtly (it is ſaid) they all [ſlumbred and ſlept] that is, thoſe that were true Chriſtians, hauing ſound fruits of pietie and ſinceritie in their hearts, and in their liues, knew their eſtate was good, and therefore waited for their Sauiour with quiet and peaceable hearts. Hypocrites alſo, ſeeing that they went beyond Atheiſts and prophane perſons, thought their caſe was good, and thereupon they grew ſecure, and neuer troubled themſelues about the aſſurance of their election: Thus farre the wiſe and fooliſh Virgins accord. But here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the fooliſh Virgins haue no more oyle then they carry in their lamps: the world may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee al that is in them: but the wiſe Virgins haue a lampe to carrie oyle, and an heart to carrie oyle:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:150583:38"/>they haue two veſſels, one for practiſe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſtore; that though the oyle in the lampe ſhould be ſpent, yet there might be a new ſupplie made.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee in how many things falſe-hearted diſſemblers come neare the ſincereſt of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Which ſerueth,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> firſt for the reproofe of them, that becauſe they liue a ciuill life, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the word and the ſacraments, thinke they haue gone farre enough, and account themſelues very good Chriſtians: this is but to be a builder, one of the ill grounds, one of the fiue fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and therefore as yet their caſe is wofull.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if thoſe that goe ſo farre,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding miſerable, then how curſed are they that haue not proceeded ſo farre? that are not builders, but deſtroyers of themſelues and others by their corrupt ſpeeches, and by their leaud example and courſe of life? that are not arable grounds, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together a wilde waſte? that are not Virgins, but doe ſtill commit ſpirituall whoredome (and that in the ſight of all the world) againſt the Lord God of heauen, that is a iealous God? If their fall ſhall be horrible and fearefull that build, and that with the good word of God; becauſe they build on an ill foundation: how terrible muſt their iudgement needs bee, that come ſo farre behind ſuch in any ſhew of goodneſſe, and goe ſo farre beyond them in euerie kinde of groſſe wickedneſſe? If theſe grounds that made ſhew of fruitfulneſſe be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe they bring not forth ripe fruite, then
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150583:39"/>what ſhall become of them that will not endure any plowing at all, but bring foorth bryars and brambles, and all maner of poyſoned weeds? And if it went ſo hard with thoſe that were Virgins, and went with their lamps to meet the bride-groome, then what muſt their doome be that are not Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, but adulterers, and adultereſſes? that loue the earth more then heauen, and earthlie things more then heauenly things? that would rather bee at a table of good cheare where their bodies may be pampered, then at the Lords table, where their ſoules might be fedde vnto eternall life? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe mens iudgement ſleepeth not, and when it ouertaketh them, woe vnto them; for their caſe will be moſt lamentable. Neither neede they cry out againſt hypocrites, for they are tenne times worſe then hypocrites, and their puniſhment muſt be ſutable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdlie,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this is for inſtruction, that ſith hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites ſeeme to draw in the ſame yoake of ſincerity with the Saints of God, therefore we ſhould ſearch our hearts and our thoughts, and not onely build aboue ground,
<note place="margin">Ier. 17.</note> but looke whether our foundation be good: for <hi>the heart is deceitfull aboue all things,</hi> yet the word of God tryeth it: that ſetteth it, as it were, vpon the racke, and is as a two-edged ſword that diuideth betweene the heart and the reines, and findeth out all ſhifts and excuſes whatſoeuer. But that we may more plainely perceiue the way how to get a ſincere heart, let vs obſerue theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections following.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:150583:39"/>
                  <p> The firſt ſhall be taken out of the text, namely,
<note place="margin">How to get and tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e an vpright heart.</note> that we muſt digge and ſearch into our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and when we find any corruption therein,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we muſt caſt it forth. It is not ſufficient to ſay, indeed I find an ill foundation, but there is no remedie, I muſt build vpon it: nay a good builder will not doe ſo, but throw out euery thing that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his foundation. And ſo ſhould wee deale with ſinne, and thereby may we try our plainneſſe, if we can ſoundly iudge our ſelues, and be glad to be admoniſhed of others, it is a ſigne that there is vprightneſſe in vs: as it is an euident token that he minds to haue a good foundation, that when his neighbour comes with a ſpade, and tels him, I ſee you haue much adoe heere, and that you neede helpe, I will ioyne with you, is glad of this newes, and thankfully acceps of him and of his labour.</p>
                  <p>This is contrary vnto the Scribes and Phariſies practiſe, who had little to ſay againſt the gifts of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and of Chriſt; but when they came to digge at their pride, and couetouſneſſe, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, they could not endure it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly another triall is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> at whoſe ſinnes wee grieue moſt. An hypocrite is the ſoreſt and buſieſt digger of all, but it is in other mens ground; but he that would haue a good foundation, muſt be moſt induſtrious in purging his owne ſoule from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. That was a complaint that <hi>Ieremie</hi> made,
<note place="margin">Ier. 8.6.</note> that no man ſaid, <hi>What haue I done?</hi> but all the ſtirre of hypocrites is, what others haue done. Whereas if we could come to this, I haue liued in this ſinne,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150583:40"/>I haue broken promiſe, I haue been vnfaithfull in Gods ſeruice: what way may I take to get peace vnto my ſoule?</p>
                  <p>This were the way indeed to get a ſound heart: and this is a good argument of a ſound hart, when the ſinnes of our owne ſoules doe more vexe vs, then all the iniuries that men haue done, or can do againſt vs, and therefore we are euer buſie in ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the hidden corruptions that lye lurking within our ſoules, that ſo our foundation may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſtill vnmoueable: for this is the difference betwixt an earthly houſe and a ſpirituall, that the one needeth but once to haue a ſure foundation laid, but the other requireth daily looking too. There is ſome one corruption or other that muſt be caſt forth: ſo that Chriſtians are ſearching and digging builders: who albeit they ſeeme to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee very blind, yet they get the greateſt meaſure of knowledge: and though they be very dead in their owne feeling, yet they carrie away the life of God and the life of grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 47. [<hi>Whoſoeuer heareth my words and doth the ſame, &amp;c. is like a man that built an houſe, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged deepe,</hi> or (as it is in <hi>Matthew) is like a wiſe builder</hi>] who before he be at any coſt wil be ſure of a good foundation, or elſe all his labour is loſt. Now the foundation of a Chriſtian is his practiſe, whence ariſeth this point: that</p>
                  <p>They are the bleſſedeſt hearers of the word,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> that are the beſt practiſers of the ſame.
<note place="margin">Hearing and doing muſt go together.</note> Therefore is it that Chriſt Ieſus pronounceth ſuch <hi>bleſſed, as heare
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150583:40"/>the word, and doe it, Luke</hi> 11.28. Yea more bleſſed then the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was for bearing Chriſt in her wombe; for that alone could not haue ſaued her: whereas the word of God heard and practiſed, is ſufficient to bring the ſoule to euerlaſting life: and not ſo alone, but it alſo giues the parties right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the enioyment of all manner of outward bleſſings whatſoeuer, as is ſhewed at large, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. The reaſons why ſuch are bleſſed, are theſe.
<label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they ſhal be able to ſtand it out in all manner of temptations, ſo that though all the diuels in hell were turned looſe vpon them, they ſhould be more then conquerours ouer them all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this maketh for the increaſing of their happineſſe, that they ſhal ſtill grow in knowledge. For our Sauiour ſaith:
<note place="margin">Iohn 7.17.</note> 
                     <hi>If any one wil do his wil he ſhal know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or no.</hi> You ſhall haue many, who before the receiuing of the Sacrament, and at ſuch like times, will deale with their Miniſter, that he would not examine them; for they are not booke learned: and beſides, they are old their memories will not ſerue them. And will you know the true reaſon hereof? it is euen that of our Sauiour: <hi>They will not do the will of God, and therefore they know it not.</hi> For their capacities and memories, and all the faculties of their ſoules and bodies will ſerue them well enough for their couetouſneſſe, for craftie and ſubtill dealing, and for ſuch pleaſures as they are addicted vnto, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this practiſing of the word will be a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150583:41"/>of an honeſt heart:
<note place="margin">Luke 8.</note> for that is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it, to heare and receiue, to vnderſtand and hold faſt the word, and to bring foorth fruite with patience. Many doubt that they haue vnſound hearts; let them bring themſelues to this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone: Do they grow to ſome fruitfulnes in good workes by the hearing of the word, and are they not diſcouraged though ſome heat of affliction do ariſe? Then our Sauiour teſtifieth that they haue good and honeſt hearts. So long as one deſires to do his duty, and from his deſire is drawne to prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and by prayer gets vertue from Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the commandements are made eaſie, ſo long he needeth not to feare his eſtate, for it is good and comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that the doers of the word,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and not the hearers are bleſſed, this ſhould teach vs to make conſcience to do as wee heare, to practiſe euery duty that is enioyned, and to eſchew euery ſinne that is reproued: otherwiſe we ſhall bee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for our hearing when others are bleſſed, and be bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>n with many ſtripes, becauſe wee knew our maſters will, and did it not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> here is a ſingular conſolation for thoſe that deſire in their hearts to doe the whole will of God; then they do it in Gods account: for with him we are reputed as we are affected: if one giue but two mites, as the poore widdow did, with a willing and cheareful hart, it ſhal be accepted and commended; yea though it be but a cup of cold water, it ſhall not go vnrewarded. A father doth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150583:41"/>not reſpect ſo much how exactly his child doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, as how obediently he performes it: and though he cannot do as he would, if he grieue and weepe, and deſire his father to helpe him to doe better, it ſufficiently contenteth a parents mind; ſo if we be ready and deſirous to do euery thing that is commanded, and to beleeue euery thing that is promiſed, and to auoide euery euill that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; Chriſt hath ſaid it, and wee ſhall finde it one day, whatſoeuer we feele now, that wee are bleſſed and happy people, members of the Sonne of God, temples of the holy Ghoſt, and the ſonnes and daughters of the euerliuing God. Our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith vnto his diſciples,
<note place="margin">Iohn 15.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Doe we then ſomething in truth of heart? then wee are in Chriſt branches of the true vine, and bringing forth fruit in him, wee ſhall bee ſtill purged to bring forth greater abundance thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>[And when the waters aroſe, the floud beate vpon that houſe, and could not ſhake it.]</hi> In that he commendeth the goodneſſe of this building, becauſe it ſtood when the ſtormes did beate vpon it, the doctrine is: that</p>
                  <p>Euery man is that in truth out of temptation,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label>
                     <note place="margin">Tryall ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is.</note> which he ſheweth himſelfe to bee in temptation. A wiſe builder is wiſe before ſtormes ariſe, though he be not put to it: but how ſhall that be knowne? by the ſtanding of his houſe in extremitie of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If in the midſt of all trials hee hold his owne and ſtand it out, and proue the ſame man ſtill, then is his wiſedome apparant to al: he that builds
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150583:42"/>on the ſand hath (it may be) as faire and goodlie a houſe in ſhew as the other; but when the winds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, it quickely tumbles downe. And ſo it is with hypocrites, if troubles bee approaching towards them, eſpecially if they once begin to pinch them, they are gone: one puffe of temptation; one ſhew of promotion; one ſtorme of affliction, makes all their building in matters of religion to become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ruinous.</p>
                  <p>So for the grounds, what could the good ground ſay for it ſelfe for a time, which the ill grounds could not? They were all plowed, they all receiued the ſeede, and brought it aboue ground, thoſe that did leaſt. Whence was the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then? The bad grounds had not the ſtones digged out, nor the thornes grubbed vp; and therefore the ſeede ſpringing vp in the one ſort, when the parching heat came, withered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and that in the other was choaked by the thornes, and ſo came to nought: each of them fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling when their triall came: whereas the good ground held out vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> was a good houſe, <hi>Iudas</hi> was an ill houſe; therefore when a ſtorme came, though <hi>Peter</hi> loſt a ſlate or two, as the beſt houſe may, yet the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and the ſide-wals ſtood firme: he wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly for his ſinne, and craued pardon for it, and ſo all was repaired. But what of <hi>Iudas?</hi> he ſtood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently well for a while: but at length when Chriſt rebuked him, hee was full of wrath; and when the high Prieſts offered him money, he was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150583:42"/>full of couetouſneſſe: and ſo thinking to gaine more by ſelling of Chriſt, then by ſeruing of him, he quite forſooke his Maſter, and ſought how to betray him to his moſt mortall aduerſaries.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being good vnder his fathers gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, continued good alſo vnder the gouernment of Infidels, where he had al meanes of damnation, but none of ſaluation; yea though he were at firſt in an vnchaſt houſe, where he was ſet vpon by his vnchaſt miſtres; and afterwards caſt in priſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the notableſt malefactors in all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: yet looke what manner of man <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was in his fathers houſe, the ſame he was ſtill, both in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphars</hi> houſe, and in the priſon; and the ſame hee continued to be when he came to great aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> court, which was the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptation of all the reſt. Hereunto wee may adde, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a young man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more likely to be caried away; but all was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: when his heart was ſound, all the powers of hell could not preuaile againſt him.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary part it is ſaid of <hi>Amaziah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Chron. 25.5.</note> that he <hi>did that which was vpright in the eyes of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</hi> Therefore marke what came of it: after that hee had ouercome the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> his heart was lifted vp, and hee (contrarie to common ſenſe) fell to worſhip their Idols, whom he had vanquiſhed in battell: he would not bee ſo preciſe any longer, nor be at the command of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prophet, but would take his liberty: and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hypocrite in the beginning, he manifeſted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150583:43"/>himſelfe to be a miſerable hypocrite in the end. So <hi>Ioaſh</hi> all the while the good Prieſt <hi>Iehoiadah</hi> liued,
<note place="margin">2. Chron. 24.</note> that would not ſuffer him to take ill courſes, was very forward, yea in ſome things more forward then <hi>Iehoiadah</hi> himſelfe:
<note place="margin">2. Kings 12.7.</note> but as ſoone as <hi>Iehoiadah</hi> was dead, his religion was dead with him, and of a profeſſour, he became a perſecutor; and nothing could ſtay him from his wicked courſes, vntill hee was taken away by a violent death.</p>
                  <p>But that the point may be yet more cleare, wee wil giue inſtance in ſome particular things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men iudge themſelues to be very ſtrong, when as the truth is they are exceeding weake.</p>
                  <p>Many will thanke God, that though in other things they come ſhort, yet they are endued with patience: but what doe they when wrongs are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them? why then they take on as bad as the worſt. Such need not brag of the aboundance of their patience, for they haue neuer a iot more then they find when iniuries are offered them.</p>
                  <p>So others there are, that hope they loue the truth: but let one of the Family of loue, or of the Browniſts ſet vpon them, and what will they doe? preſently begin to thinke, and ſpeake hardly of the ſeruants and ſeruices of God, and of the truth of God. This plainely argueth that there was in the heart but little loue of the truth, but much prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and aptneſſe vnto errours and hereſies. He is the truly couragious ſouldiers that will ſtand to it, when the skirmiſh is at hotteſt: as for thoſe that wil bragge much before, and betake them to their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150583:43"/>heeles, or ioyne (for feare) with the aduerſarie when the battell begins, they are meere cowards, vtterly vnworthy of the name of ſouldiers.</p>
                  <p>Againe, others are conceited that they haue mercifull hearts; but hereby they manifeſt the quite contrary, that they giue ſo little of their ſuperfluity to thoſe that are in neceſſity, whoſe hearts might bee gladded, and whoſe ſoules might bee ſtirred vp to offer praiſes and prayers vnto the Lord for them, in regard of their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
                  <p>Others againe will not be perſwaded, but they make conſcience of the Sabbath: but if there be occaſion of trauell offered on that day, will they not rather God ſhould loſe his glory, then they their commodity? yes ſurely, and thereby they ſhew themſelues to be but prophane perſons, that did neuer conſcionably ſanctify the Sabbath: for if they had done ſo, euery ſleight temptation would neuer carry them ſo farre wide.</p>
                  <p>This ſerueth for comfort vnto thoſe that haue laid a ſure foundation:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> it is impoſſible that they ſhould fall away; for temptations doe not make thoſe that are good to become ill, but onelie trie what euery one is. Gold is as good when it comes out of the fire, as when it is caſt in, nay better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times; whereas copper that was before gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in ſhew, appeares to bee that indeed which formerly it was, though men diſcerned it not ſo well till it had gone through the fire.

                  <p>Indeed Gods deare children may be ſomewhat
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150583:45"/>frighted and terrified at firſt, but they quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer themſelues againe: being therein like a pure ſpring, which being trodde in by beaſts, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way ſtirred, will bee ſomewhat muddy for a while; but come within an houre after, and you ſhall finde it ſettled againe. Therefore Chriſtians ſhould not bee diſcouraged, though they finde a paſſion of feare, and vnbeliefe now and then, if ſo bee ordinarily they ſend foorth pure water: for there is a great difference betwixt them and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, who are filthy puddles, hauing a little faire water running on the top; but if they be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and raked into, they will appeare to bee moſt loathſome, neither will they bee eaſily ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ruine in the ſoule, which is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent part.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore, the effects wil proue as much, which are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Monſtrous ſhame; for when any one falles from profeſſion, all the world ſees hee was but an hypocrite at beſt: and then prophane perſons will inſult and triumph; Theſe are your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; theſe are they that will heare Sermons; they are as bad people as any liuing; I will truſt none of them all for ſuch a ones ſake: and thus they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe infamy and diſgrace vnto themſelues, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> did.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And not only ſo, but alſo euerlaſting paines, as we ſee in <hi>Iudas;</hi> who did not only die a baſe kind of death, being his owne executioner, and hauing his filthy bowels, that had been ſo full of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150583:46"/>and cruelty, guſhing out: but alſo ſeeking to exempt himſelfe from the paines and gripings of an euill conſcience, hee caſt himſelfe into the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, which are eaſeleſſe and endleſſe.</p>
                  <p>For inſtruction,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that wee ſhould labour to ſet ſure in the things of God: for better is it to haue any decay, then a decay in the conſcience: and to haue any loſſe and hurt, then thoſe which are in the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Now if we would not haue a great and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fall, let vs take the direction of <hi>Iude,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iude 20.</note> which he giues as a preſeruatiue againſt apoſtacie. <hi>But ye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>edifie your ſelues in your moſt holy faith.</hi> That is the firſt thing, that wee muſt ſtill bee building vp of our ſelues, and ſtriue to bee better and better: for we are like a boate that goes againſt the ſtreame; if wee labour not with might and maine to rowe vpward, we ſhal be carried violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly downeward.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond thing is, that we muſt <hi>pray in the holie Ghoſt.</hi> Many will bragge that they ſay their praiers morning and night: but doe they pray their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? A parrot may ſay a praier, but Chriſtians muſt pray in the holy Ghoſt, that is, with ſuch petitions as the Spirit warranteth, &amp; with ſighes &amp; groanes which it worketh in the heart. Theſe two things whoſoeuer can practiſe, namely, to build vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe daily, and offer vp faithful prayers vnto God, he ſhall be ſure to ſtand faſt and firme.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> this is for comfort to thoſe on whom the Lord hath beſtowed his good Spirit: for if it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:150583:47"/>be the greateſt fall to fall from religion, then it is the greateſt riſing to riſe vnto grace: and if they be curſed that fal away, then bleſſed are thoſe that draw neare vnto God, and with full purpoſe of heart cleaue vnto him, growing daily in humilitie, and in contempt of the world, in conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and in care to leade a good and holie life before men. This is indeed the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion: and therefore <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let the brother that is of low degree,
<note place="margin">Iames 1.9.</note> reioyce in that he is exalted.</hi> Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (might ſome ſay:) what exaltation is that, when they are as poore as euer they were?

<note place="margin">Reuel. 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and many other reprobates, went beyond ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of vs for outward things: but al that aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to their greater ſhame and confuſion. For earthly promotion is nothing elſe but an high ſtage, and if one be an idiote, itwere better for him to play his part on the ground: if thoſe that are in eminent places haue not power to maſter their owne luſts and carnall affections, they are but great fooles vpon an high ſtage. Therefore let vs ſeeke for ſpirituall things more then for earthly, and bee more thankfull and ioyfull when we find grace in our hearts, then if we ſhould find many mines of gold, which none could lay claime vnto but our ſelues.</p>

                  <p>Verſ. 5. <hi>[There they ſhall be taken with feare]</hi> Wee may reade in the former part of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> how forward theſe men were vnto al vngodlineſſe, and vnrighteouſneſſe;
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> and now ſee how they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and thence learne this doctrine:
<note place="margin">Boldneſſe in ſinne brings daſtardlineſſe afterward.</note> that thoſe that are moſt bold to commit ſinne, are moſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly when dangers doe approch. Hardineſſe, and venturouſnes in euill courſes, hath common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daſtardlineſſe attending thereupon, when any occaſion of feare is offered. <hi>There they ſhall bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with feare</hi> (ſaith the Prophet,) that is, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry height of their impiety againſt the Lord, and of their cruelty againſt his ſeruants; euen there they ſhall bee ſurprized with horrour and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, albeit they in their follie ſay, <hi>There is no God;</hi> and therefore ruſh into all abominations, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſting off the yoake of obedience, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in nothing more, then in deuouring Gods people: yet will hee make them know that there is a God in heauen, that takes notice of their

For when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of all manner of ſafety, and doe not ſo much as dreame of any perill that is toward, becauſe of the weakeneſſe and baſeneſſe of their aduerſaries; then ſome vnexpected euill ſhall ouertake them, and anguiſh ſhall come vpon them,

                  </p>
                  <p>This point may bee made yet more plaine by examples.
<note place="margin">2. Chron. 18.23.</note> King <hi>Ahaz</hi> was maruellous bold in his idolatrous and wicked courſes, reiecting the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and bringing in heatheniſh abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations

If the Egyptians be vanity, their helpe muſt needs be vaine. And the like may be ſaid of all other particulars: Doe we reſt vpon our friends? they may die, or their good affection may die. Doe we rely vpon riches? they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to ruſt, ſubiect to fire, ſubiect to theeues, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they helpe vs in the euill day.</hi>

                  <p> Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> no worldly meanes can helpe the ſoule againſt ſin; and therefore there is no ſound comfort to be expected from them. Euery mans ruine is from himſelfe, and bred in his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: helpe that and helpe all; and except that bee helped, when a man hath done all hee can, he hath done nothing: for let a man haue neuer ſo many friends, neuer ſo much wealth, neuer ſo great credit, or whatſoeuer elſe can bee named, if his ſoule bee vncured, hee is a miſerable creature: <hi>there is no peace to the wicked:</hi> one vile luſt or other will bee raging in his heart, and diſquieting his ſoule,

                  <p>Thirdly, no earthly helpes can keepe off the plagues of God from a man, or remoue them where they are already. Suppoſe that the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſhoote his arrow of peſtilence to ſtrike a man, or a family, a towne, or a city, what buckler can beare it off? what wit, or wealth, or friends can ſhelter vs from his ſtrokes, and keepe vs from the graue when he calleth for vs? ſurely there are no worldly meanes that can doe it; and therefore we may wel conclude, that all the helpe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from them, is altogether vaine.</p>
                  <p>Which ſhould cauſe vs not greatly to ſeeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:150583:71"/>for though we haue them in neuer ſo great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, we ſhal find them to be but miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters when we ſtand in moſt neede. Moſt men are of another mind; namely, that the treaſures and promotions of the world, and the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of great men, are the onely things to bee looked after, and that the promiſes of God, and the comforts of his word, are vaine and friuolous: but when they haue made triall as <hi>Salomon</hi> did, they ſhall finde, that <hi>to feare God and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> is the only happineſſe, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the world can afford, is meere <hi>vanity, and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, let this teach vs in all our griefes to ſay as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> doth, <hi>Lord helpe in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for vaine is the helpe of man. q. d.</hi> I haue depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much vpon the arme of fleſh, but now I am growne to this reſolution, that if I had all worldly helpes, I would not truſt in them, becauſe they are vaine; and if I want them all, I would relie vpon thee, that doeſt neuer faile ſuch as ſeeke vnto thee. Thus if we can doe, we ſhall neuer bee diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our hope:

                  <p>We reade in the 11. chapter of <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell,
<note place="margin">Iohn 11.7.</note> that when Chriſt was about to goe into Iudea, his Diſciples diſſwaded him, ſaying, <hi>Maſter, the Iewes ſought lately to ſtone thee, and doeſt thou goe thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, haue you no more care of your owne ſafety, but to runne euen vpon the ſwords point, and to caſt your ſelfe into the Lions mouth? But <hi>Ieſus anſwered, are there not twelue houres in the day? if a man walke in the day, he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the light of this world:</hi> as if he had ſaid, though wicked men goe about to kill me, yet ſeeing God calleth methither; for all their madneſſe, they ſhall not be able to hurt me: for I walke in the light all the while that I goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my fathers buſineſſe; and as there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſtumbling ſo long as a man hath the day light to guide him: ſo is there no perill to bee ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from men, ſo long as a man hath the light of a good confcience to aſſure him that hee is about thoſe works which God calleth him vnto. Indeed if a man be otherwiſe imployed, then he <hi>walkes in the night,</hi> as our Sauiour ſpeaketh, and then he may

                  </p>
                  <p>And there is good reaſon why it ſhould be ſo:

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                     </label> for ſo long men doe much honour God, as they keepe themſelues within the limits of their owne callings; and therfore he cannot chuſe but watch ouer them in goodneſſe. Now that they doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God thereby, appeareth by that of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, where he ſaith; <hi>I haue glorified thee vpon earth?</hi> How proues he that? <hi>I haue finiſhed the worke which thou gauest me to doe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then are thoſe to be reproued,

To giue inſtance in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, many are ſo afraid of pouerty, that they wil not be content with that employment which God hath giuen them, but will haue an oare in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery boate, and bee dealing in this trade, and in that, wherein they haue not been trained vp; but what comes of it? they caſt themſelues into farre greater arrearages then they were in before, and intangle themſelues in ſuch ſort, that they know
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:150583:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>not how to winde out. Beſides that, the cares of the world, and the deſire of riches doe choake the word, that it cannot bring forth ripe fruit in them, and marueilouſly hinder the peace and comfort of their conſciences. Oh but their meaning was good: they had an honeſt care to prouide for their wife and children; an honeſt care? nay it is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full care, that make men to be ſuch buſie bodies: and iuſt it is, that they that will not truſt God with their wiues and children, ſhould by tumbling and toſſing vp and downe the world, ſpending all, as theſe Iewes did, and feele that which they feared, lying heauie vpon them: So others are afraid of the Peſtilence, and what doe they to preuent it? caſt about where they may dwel in ſafety (as they imagine) in being many miles off from the places infected: though in the meane while they neglect their callings, ſhew little regard of their wiues &amp; children, and ſeruants, and leaſt of all of their own ſoules: whereas <hi>their ſtrength had been to ſit ſtill,</hi> and neuer to forſake the workes of their vocations, nor the ordinances of God eſpecially; and then either the infection ſhould not come neare them; or if it did, it ſhould bee a meanes of great good vnto them, either for the perfecting of their graces, or for the ending of their miſeries, &amp; the beginning of their eternall happineſſe.

<note place="margin">Open ſinnes muſt haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſhame.</note> and the perſons neuer ſo great, yet that muſt not ſtop the mouthes of Gods Miniſters and ſeruants, but they muſt the rather be rebuked, that thereby if it be poſſible, they may be truly humbled. As in this place we ſee, the Noble men, and Embaſſadours were very buſie in raiſing large ſummes of money to ſend vnto the King of Egypt for helpe, yet
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:150583:76"/>though it were the ſin almoſt of the whole land, and the hand of the rulers was chiefe in it, the Prophet is charged to ſpeake againſt them, and to write againſt them, and to ſhame them, not onely for the preſent, but for euer, if they did not turne to the Lord by ſound repentance. The like is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned this ſame Prophet, chap. 58. verſ. 1. <hi>Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.</note> ſpare not: lift vp thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſsion, and the houſe of Iacob their ſinnes.</hi> They pretended great zeale and forwardneſſe in religion: they would <hi>ſeeke the knowledge of Gods word; they would enquire after the ordinances of iuſtice; they would faſt alſo,</hi> and vſe much ſtrictneſſe in outward ſhew: yet becauſe they were full of hypocriſie, of cruelty and oppreſſion, of impiety and Sabbath breaking, and ſuch like hainous crimes, he muſt openly exclaime againſt their ill courſes; and as the trumpet ſpares none, but wakens all, both great and ſmall, ſo muſt hee deale; letting euery one heare of his faults of what ſtate and condition ſoeuer. This was alſo laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Timothie.
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.20.</note> Them that ſinne, rebuke openly, that the reſt may feare,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) and it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by our Sauiour, who ſeeing that the Scribes and Phariſies made more account of their owne traditions, then of Gods commandements, and that they ſought themſelues in ambition and filthy lucre, he doth ſharpely and openly reproue them,
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> and diſgrace them, and pronounce woes and curſes againſt them. The like doth <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> calling them a <hi>generation of Vipers:</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:150583:76"/>meeting with <hi>Ananias,</hi> a notorious hypocrite, who commanded him to be ſmitten on the face, for the diſgrace of his perſon, and of his cauſe,
<note place="margin">Act. 23.3.</note> hee boldly ſets vpon him, ſaying, <hi>God will ſmite thee thou painted wall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why publike offences ſhould haue open rebuke, is;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that others hearing it,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> may bee terrified from the ſame; and ſo ſuch ſinnes may be leſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, according to the place before alleaged, <hi>Them that ſinne, rebuke openly,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.20.</note> that the reſt may feare]</hi> and ſo conſequently bee reſtrained from the like courſes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that if it be poſſible,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the parties offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may be conuerted: according to that of the Apoſtle. <hi>The Cretians are alwaies liers, euill beaſts,
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.12.13.</note> ſlow bellies: wherefore reproue them ſharpely, that they may bee [found in the faith.]</hi> For when men are ſet vpon the ſtage, and expoſed to open ſhame, they will take it to heart, and if any thing will worke vpon them for their reformation, this will: and if they proue incorrigible notwithſtanding this, yet this benefit will come of it, that they ſhall bee more inexcuſeable in the day of the Lord, in that they heard their ſins ſo much diſgraced, and the vengeance of God denounced againſt the ſame, and yet would not breake off the practiſe of them by ſound repentance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it makes greatly for the glory of God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when hee executeth his iudgements vpon them in this world: for thoſe that haue heard their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:150583:77"/>groſſe and hainous offences inueighed againſt, and withall are witneſſes of their wilfull continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therein, they cannot but in their conſciences iuſtifie the Lord in his proceeding againſt them. That was it eſpecially that cauſed <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſhame himſelfe publikely, after that hee had committed adultery and murther, that God might <hi>bee pure when hee iudged.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.4.</note> Otherwiſe men might haue thought the Lord too ſeuere, in inflicting ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments vpon him as afterwards he taſted of.</p>
                  <p>Here then in the firſt place is an inſtruction for Miniſters,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> and ſuch as haue cauſe and calling to deale with offenders, that they ſuffer not their mouthes to be ſhut by reaſon of the multitude, or greatneſſe of the perſons that are faulty; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the offence, ſo to apply their reproofes accordingly: if they diſhonour God openly, let them heare of it openly: and if they will ſet their ſinnes vpon the ſtage, let vs ſet their ſhame there alſo, that thoſe that are witneſſes of the one, may be alſo witneſſes of the other: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhall be iniurious vnto God, and vnto men; vnto the offenders, and vnto our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their blood ſhall bee required at our hands. Therfore let vs carefully looke vnto this duty, and the more oppoſition we finde againſt the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, the more let vs pray for ſtrength and courage to go through with the ſame; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is a great deale better that men ſhould be offended with vs for doing our duty, then that God ſhould plague vs for omitting our duty.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:150583:77"/>
                     <hi>Steuen</hi> knew that moſt of thoſe vnto whom hee was to ſpeake would not take a reproofe at his hands: yet he ſaw that he had a calling to giue it,
<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> and they had need of it; and therfore he tels them roundly of their faults, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſtifnecked, and of vncircumciſed hearts and eares, ye haue alwaies reſiſted the holy Ghoſt: as your fathers did, ſo doe you,</hi> &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hereupon they gnaſhed their teeth at him, and ſtopped their eares, that they might not heare him, and ſo running vpon him with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and outrage, ſtoned him to death: but what loſt hee by that? hee parted with a fraile and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable life, and went preſently to enioy an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and moſt bleſſed kingdome in the heauens. Let vs therefore be reſolute and couragious as he was, and neuer feare the faces of mortall men; knowing that there is no greater danger then for a man to neglect his duty; nor greater comfort then to performe it, though it bee the loſſe of his life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is it ſo that open ſinnes muſt haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen rebuke? hence then let vs learne, that if wee would not haue Gods Miniſter to lay open our ſhame before the congregation, wee muſt take heed of groſſe, and foule, and ſcandalous offences. For if we liue in continuall ſwearing, or Sabbath-breaking, or brawling, or whoring, or ſtealing, or any the like inordinate courſes, ſo that by our ill conuerſation, we cauſe Gods glorious name to be ill ſpoken of, wee muſt looke to heare of it to our iuſt diſgrace: and if wee ſet light by Gods glory,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:150583:78"/>there is no reaſon that his ſeruants ſhould make any reckoning of our credit. Let men therefore be carefull to auoide publike euils, or elſe prepare themſelues for publike rebukes, which are the beſt medicines for the recouering of their ſicke and ſinfull ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Now goe and write it before them in a booke, that that it may bee for the laſt day, [for euer and euer.]</hi> Hence ariſeth this doctrine, that</p>

                     <note place="margin">Gods teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</note> which God giueth him in his word.</p>
                  <p>Looke what the Lord ſaith of any one, that ſhal ſtand firme, and tarrie with him till death, yea after death, euen for euer and euer. As here the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> from the Lords mouth chargeth theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Iewes to bee diſſemblers and rebels: this hath ſtood in record againſt them many hundred yeares, and doth ſtill; their names are not yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor euer ſhall be, but all that liued and died in their impenitency, ſhall haue their ſhame encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the day of the Lord, and that ſhall tarrie with them for euermore. This is alſo euident in the Scribes and Phariſies, who though they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away all the praiſe and commendation among men, our Sauiour doth diſgrace to the vttermoſt, calling them painted ſepulchres,
<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> that had faire outſides, but within were full of corruption, and withal denouncing many curſes and woes againſt them: now who are more odious then they? what name of greater infamie among men then the name of <hi>Phariſee?</hi> and what is the reaſon hereof?
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:150583:78"/>ſurely this; the word of God doth diſgrace ſuch kind of people; and therefore it ſtickes ſo faſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and ſhall doe for euer. So on the other ſide <hi>Paul</hi> was much ſlandered and reuiled, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a peſtilent fellow, a troubler of the world, and the ringleader of heretickes,
<note place="margin">Act. 24.</note> and <hi>Tertullus</hi> made ſuch a bitter oration againſt him, and brought ſuch witneſſes to confirme his ſpeeches, that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man would haue thought his name almoſt vncureable: yet who more honourable then <hi>Paul?</hi> his very name doth carrie a wonderful reuerence with it, and that in the very hearts of wicked men. But how commeth it to paſſe that hee that was then ſo ſhamefully traduced, ſhould now bee ſo highly magnified? this is the true reaſon of it; he did that which the word of God did commend, though men did condemne it; and therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a good teſtimony from heauen, all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations and ſlanders of men could nothing at all impeach his credit, but did rather cauſe it to ſhine out more clearely. The Scriptures abound with examples of this kinde, but I haſten to the reaſons, which are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> the word of God doth giue men neither more nor leſſe then their due, it paſſeth a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentence; and therefore it muſt needs ſtand. The world commonly calles good euill, and euill good: light darkeneſſe, and darkeneſſe light; and therefore the teſtimony therof is little worth, and of ſmall or no continuance: but the word of God pronounceth none good, or bad, vnleſſe they bee
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:150583:79"/>ſo. If the courſe of a mans life be ſuch as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe commend, though all the world ſpeake againſt it, it is commendable: and if it bee ſuch as the word diſcommendeth, though men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhould ſpeake for it, it is to bee diſliked and condemned:
<note place="margin">Pſa. 12.6.</note> for <hi>the words of the Lord are pure words, as ſiluer tried in the furnace of earth, fined ſeuen fold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as the Scripture giues a ſound teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, ſo the Lord himſelfe will backe it, and make it good. The word denounceth ſhame vpon all ſinners; therefore muſt God of neceſſity powre it vpon them; for elſe hee ſhould not bee true in his threatnings. Earthly Princes doe enact penall lawes and ſtatutes, and yet many times doe not ſee them executed: but God deales not ſo; but whoſoeuer doth perſiſt in his wickedneſſe, is ſure to meete with diſgrace in the end: as godly men ſhall <hi>inherite glory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou 3.35.</note> though they bee vilified and debaſed for a time; ſo ſhall ſinners inherit <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour</hi> (as the Wiſe man affirmeth) <hi>though they be exalted for a ſeaſon.</hi> Durable ſinnes ſhall haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding ſhame; and conſtant obedience ſhall haue euerlaſting glory: euery man ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue according to his workes, whether good or euill.</p>
                  <p>This then may ſerue to diſcouer vnto vs their follie and madneſſe,

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:150583:79"/>and of all manner of iniquity: is this the way to get good eſtimation, and laſting cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? nay, the Lord ſaith,

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> if wee deſire to haue a good name while we liue, to leaue it behind vs when we die, and to haue euerlaſting honour before all the Saints and Angels for euer, then let vs take ſuch courſes as God himſelfe doth approue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. Let vs get faith and loue in our hearts, and let vs manifeſt the fruits thereof in our liues: let vs be truly religious towards God, and zealous in his ſeruice: let vs be righteous towards men, and carrie a liberall heart, and a bountifull hand for good and mercifull vſes:

Tell them a tale of lucre, which they may get; or of ſome iniurie done vnto them; whereof they may take aduantage, and their eares are wide open for ſuch matters: but let there bee any ſpeech vſed tending to the glory of God, or the ſaluation of their ſoules, they are altogether deafe, and cannot with any life or cheerfulnes liſten to ſuch things. Now how comes their eares to be thus vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed?
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:150583:85"/>becauſe their hearts are vncircumciſed: (which is the ſecond cauſe of their vnwillingneſſe to attend to the words of wiſedome:) And this appeareth in two things: the firſt is, that (as <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>they delight not in Gods voice.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 6.10.</note> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that <hi>they doe take pleaſure in vnrighteouſneſſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle witneſſeth.
<note place="margin">2.

And thus much for the cauſes of this vnwillingneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The ill effects follow,
<note place="margin">2. The effects.</note> which (to mention but a few of a great many) are three. The two former in reſpect of men them felues, the laſt in reſpect of God.</p>
                  <p>Concerning themſelues,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt, they are neuer able to meditate on the word. For whatſoeuer a man comes vnwillingly to hearken vnto, that will quickly ſlip out of his minde, neither can he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly get it to take any deepe roote in his heart. Hence is it that when couetous, or malicious, or vnchaſt perſons repaire vnto Sermons to pleaſe their maſters, or to ſatisfie the law, or for ſome ſuch by reſpect, they neuer ſeriouſly thinke of that which they haue heard, to make any application thereof vnto themſelues; they cannot bring their hearts vnto it: for a ſinfull conſcience will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be tied to the word of the Lord. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:150583:85"/>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord how loue I thy law?
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.97.</note> my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is in it continually.</hi> What will follow then if a man doe not loue Gods law? Surely, he will not at any time meditate theron: which he that doth not, muſt needs be a very ſinfull creature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as hee will neuer ponder vpon it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo neither will he practiſe it. Hee that is vnwilling to heare his dutie, will bee much more vnwilling to doe it. If wee ſee a ſeruant that cannot endure to be informed what is his maſters will and pleaſure, we preſently conclude that ſuch an one will not proue a faithfull and truſty ſeruant: and ſo may we do without any breach of charity, when wee perceiue a man to be altogether careleſſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous in liſtening to the charge of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly maſter: he that cannot abide to heare of the duties of the Sabbath, nor of the exerciſes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that he is to performe in his familie, and the like, we may boldly ſay, except the Lord conuert this mans heart, certainly he will neuer make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of performing theſe duties.</p>
                  <p>Now for the effect which they ſhall find from the Lord, it is this that he will deale with them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as with wicked and vngodly ones, both in this life, and afterwards:
<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for the iuſt reproofe of many among vs, who will come vnto the Church, and ſit before the Preacher, as men and women deſiring to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the knowledge of Gods waies, whereas in truth the Lord and their owne conſciences can witneſſe, that they are altogether vnwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any wholeſome admonition and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that no charge is, or can bee more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:150583:86"/>and diſtaſtfull vnto them, then that of the God of heauen, when he ſtraitly enioyneth them with all ſpeed to get out of their ſins, and to turne their feet into the way of his teſtimonies. And becauſe they will bee very loath to acknowledge thus much, but are ready to harbour too good an opinion of themſelues, as if none were more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hearers then they are, let their owne hearts bee iudges, what preparation they make before hand for the fitting of themſelues for ſuch a great worke; what attention they vſe when they are preſent, and what meditation and conference they haue concerning it when they are departed. Of which points if they would without partiality examine themſelues, they ſhould eaſily diſcerne a great deale of backwardneſſe in their nature, and in their practiſe. If a man ſhould proteſt that hee goes to the market with a great deſire to buy food for himſelfe and his family, yet if he alwaies play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vnthrift with his money, and neuer brought home any prouiſion, we would not giue credit to his words, but account him a meere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler: and the like cenſure may wee paſſe on ſuch, as pretend they are willing to reape benefit by the word, to the intent they may bee able to helpe both themſelues and their families, and yet neuer carrie away any thing to the purpoſe, but if they aske them what points were handled, they can ſay nothing but this, ſurely wee heard a very good Sermon, God be thanked, but my memory is very ſhort, or, I cannot vtter all that I haue in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:150583:87"/>my mind: my heart, I hope, is as good as the beſt, though I cannot talke of the Sermon as others doe: what is this but to deceiue their owne ſoules with vaine words? for certainely hee that hath a heart willing to heare, will haue a tongue readie to vtter, in ſome tolerable ſort, that which hee hath heard, though not all of it, yet a good part of it, as God hath giuen to euery one the meaſure of grace.</p>
                  <p>Another ſort are here to be reproued, who doe in a more palpable and groſſe manner manifeſt their vnwillingneſſe to heare, in that they wil take euery ſleight occaſion to abſent themſelues, and that not onely on the weeke daies, but on the Lords day alſo: ſo that when the Lord commeth euen to their dores, and offereth to powre downe his graces abundantly vpon them, they refuſe his gracious offer,

                  <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> purge our hearts by true and vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:150583:87"/>from the venome of all groſſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes, yea from the allowance and liking of the leaſt infirmities: for otherwiſe if our ſoules bee clogged with poyſoned humours of ſinne, wee ſhall find no manner of appetite, or affection to our ſpirituall food. Wherefore the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> exhorting the twelue tribes to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word with meekeneſſe,</hi> preſcribeth them what courſe to take for the preparing of their hearts thereunto,

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let vs conſider of the excellency of the word, and meditate on the ſtrange and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects that it worketh: as namely, how <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> it is euery way:

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when wee feele within vs a great vnwillingneſſe to hearken to the word (as the fleſh will alwaies bee vnwilling to that which will mortifie and kill the ſinfull luſts thereof) let vs ſay with the Prophet <hi>Dauid,

<label type="milestone">

                     <p>As any man of God preacheth more ſoundly, and commeth nearer the conſcience, ſo is hee more abhorred of vngodly men.</p>
                     <p>This we may ſee euidently in ſundry examples of Scripture, as firſt of all in thoſe of whom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made in the Reuelation, where it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 11.</note> that there were two witneſſes, that is, a competent and ſufficient number of faithfull Preachers, which were like <hi>Oliue trees,</hi>

<note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> It is ſaid that <hi>theſe two Prophets vexed them that dwealt on the earth:</hi> that is, all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men: all ſuch as were ignorant and proud, vnchaſt and couetous: ſo that they could neuer be well, till they had killed them, and caſt out their corpſes into the ſtreets of the city: but then they were glad and reioyced, and ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents one to another in token of their ioy, hoping that now theſe two witneſſes were diſpatched out of the way, they ſhould go on merrily in their leaud courſes, and liue at hearts eaſe.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Ahab</hi> profeſſeth that hee hated the Prophet <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and could not abide him: how came that to paſſe? he could like well enough of thoſe foure hundred falſe Prophets that were entertained at <hi>Iezabels</hi> table: this was the very true cauſe; <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> neuer <hi>prophecied good vnto him,

                     <p>The like may be ſeene in <hi>Paul,</hi> who for deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the holy and powerfull doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, was counted a peſtilent fellow,

                        </label> The reaſons why pure and holy doctrine is ſo
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:150583:90"/>vnpleaſant and vnwelcome vnto impure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy perſons, are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> becauſe it doth maruellouſly croſſe their wretched luſts, and goes againſt thoſe euill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions which they are determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to follow: they would bee proud; but the word tels them,
<note place="margin">Iam. 4.</note> that then the Lord will reſiſt them, and at length confound them bodies and ſoules: they would bee alwaies rooting in the earth, and ſcraping together the pelfe of this world;
<note place="margin">Reuel. 22.</note> but the word tels them, that ſuch ſwine ſhall be without, that is, excluded from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Ieruſalem, and haue their portion in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Now when they are reſolued to bee proud ſtill, and to bee rooters ſtill, and the Miniſters of God are euer and anon grating vpon their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences for the ſame, they are much imbittered and incenſed againſt them, and their doctrine, and if they can worke them any miſchiefe, they ſhall be ſure not to miſſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſuch kinde of doctrine doth much diſgrace both their courſes and perſons: for it is the ſquare, whereby ſuch crooked peeces are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and the touchſtone wherby wicked mens vnſoundnes is diſcouered. Hence is it that when our Sauiour had inueighed againſt the hypocriſie of the Scribes and Phariſies, an expounder of the law anſwered,
<note place="margin">Luk 9 45.46.</note> and ſaid vnto him, <hi>Maſter, thus ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thou putteſt vs to rebuke alſo:</hi> as if hee ſhould
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:150583:90"/>haue ſaid, Be aduiſed what you ſpeak: for this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of yours tendeth to our diſgrace, as wel as vnto theirs. But what? doth our Sauiour forbeare them hereupon? nay, hee commeth nearer vnto them, and driueth the naile to the head, ſaying, <hi>Woe be vnto you alſo ye Interpretors of the law:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Will you play the diſſemblers, and muſt not a man ſpeake againſt your ſin for feare of diſgracing you? Yes ſurely, ſin muſt haue ſhame whereſoeuer it is; and therefore woe vnto you alſo yee Lawyers, for without repentance your caſe is very dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the diuell is much diſquieted with right and powerfull doctrine. If a man come with the ſword of the Spirit to ſtrike down right vpon the ſinnes of mens ſoules, and to ſummon their drowſie conſciences before the iudgement ſeate of Ieſus Chriſt, that is the next way to thruſt the diuell out of poſſeſſion,
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.18.</note> and to caſt him violently out of their harts, euen as the lightening fals from the cloud. And this we muſt make full reckoning of, that whatſoeuer diſlikes the diuell,
<note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> the ſame will diſlike the children of the diuell. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may obſerue,
<note place="margin">Act. 16.17. &amp;c.</note> that when <hi>Paul</hi> at Philippi had caſt out the diuell of the maid that had a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diuination, Satan himſelfe being enraged thereby, all the city was in an vprore againſt him and <hi>Silas,</hi> and commanded them to be grieuouſly ſcourged with roddes, and after to bee laid faſt as cloſe priſoners, with their feet in the ſtocks.</p>

Examples will make this point yet more cleare. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was minded to paſſe an vniuſt ſentence of death vpon the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans and Aſtrologians,
<note place="margin">Dan. 2.14.</note> for that they could not bring to his minde his dreame, which he himſelfe had forgotten, he made great ſpeed in the matter, in ſo much that he adiudged all to die, not onely thoſe that had bin examined, but all ſuch as were of that profeſſion, yea not onely thoſe that were Sorcerers and Coniurers indeed, but <hi>Daniel</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:150583:92"/>his companions, that were but onely ſuppoſed to be ſuch, whereas they did in truth abhor all thoſe vnlawfull and diuelliſh Arts. If it had been ſome matter tending to Gods glory, or the good of his Church, hee would not haue been ſo ready to yeeld vnto it, and if ſuch a ſentence had been paſt, there would haue been many obiections and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ſo that the execution thereof would hardly haue followed ſo ſpeedily, as this heere did; in which regard <hi>Daniel</hi> taketh exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ſaying, <hi>Why is the ſentence ſo haſtie from the King?</hi> The like forwardneſſe was there in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing Iſraelites vnto the foule and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinne of Idolatrie:
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.3.</note> 
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> had laboured much to perſwade them to make a couenant with God, and to cleaue vnto him in faithfull and conſtant obedience; yet when hee had been a while out of the way, they would needs haue a golden Calfe in ſtead of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to goe before them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all of a ſudden they came with great violence vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> vrging him to make them one: hee being afraid to croſſe them and to diſpleaſe them, goeth about by carnall policie to ſtay them from their wickedneſſe, and therefore calleth for their golden care rings, thinking that they would at no hand haue parted with them: but when it was for the erecting of Idolatry, hee could no ſooner aske for them, but they preſently brouget them.

                        <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.8.</note> the people were exceeding bountifull in beſtowing their corne and wine, and oyle, together with their gold and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our fleſh is wholly bent vnto that which is ſinfull.
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> 
                        <hi>All the imaginations of the thoughts of our harts are only euil,</hi> and that <hi>continually.</hi> So that when wee are about any wicked practiſe, wee haue the whole force and ſtrength of nature to helpe vs forward: as on the contrary, when wee are about any goodneſſe, wee haue the whole current and ſtreame of the fleſh againſt vs, ſtill readie to ſtop and hinder vs. Wee are neuer exerciſed in that which is naturall vnto vs, vntill we be plotting, or practiſing ſome wickednes againſt God, or ſome vnrighteouſneſſe againſt men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the diuell is ready to driue the fleſh
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:150583:93"/>onward vnto that which is euill. In which reſpect it is ſaid, that <hi>the wiſedome which is not from aboue,</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the world is ready to ioyne with vs in any vnwarrantable and bad courſes, ſo that if wee be addicted to couetouſneſſe, or vainglory, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe, wee ſhall haue commendation and incouragement from carnal people:
<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.19.</note> for the world loues, as it owne perſons, ſo likewiſe it own works; ſuch as are thoſe before mentioned: and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it loues, that it commends: now praiſe is it which earthly minded men doe much hunt for, and that makes them ſo eager and ſwift of foot in following after thoſe things which the men of this world do affect and like of. They would faine haue preſent paiment, and are loath to looke after thoſe things which are not ſeene: they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue their fenſe ſatisfied, then their hope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, (that which they haue, not being a ſound hope) and therefore they chuſe rather the practiſe of thoſe euils, whereby they imagine to obtaine ſome preſent contentment, then the performance of ſuch good duties, as would hereafter procure them an eternall weight of glory, beſides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent peace and comfort which from the ſame would ariſe vnto them.</p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:150583:94"/>
                     <p> Hereby then (in the firſt place) is diſcouered their follie and ſimplicitie,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> that haue a great opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the religion of Papiſts, and of their liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both which (as may euidently appeare by this Doctrine) are altogether vaine, and of no value at all. Firſt, concerning their religion, many doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of it in regard of the vniuerſality thereof, and that there are ſuch multitudes that doe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it: but what better argument can we deſire againſt it then this, which they would haue to make for it? For all (as hath been formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) are naturally moſt enclinable vnto that which is euill: and therefore moſt men being ſo prone vnto Poperie, what can bee concluded but this,
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.</note> that it is an euill and damnable religion? Chriſt his flocke is a little flocke, and he hath but a few ſheepe that will hearken vnto his voice, and bee ordered and guided by his Spirit: what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine then can we imagine that to be, but the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of diuels, vnto which ſuch multitudes are ready to giue eare, and to conforme themſelues without any great contradiction?</p>
                     <p>Then further, as touching their liberality which they ſo much ſtand vpon, and boaſt of, what matter of commendation can wee finde therein, ſeeing it tendeth onely and wholly to the maintenance of Idolatry? to the furtherance of ſuperſtition? and to the ſetting vp of themſelues in the roome and ſtead of Chriſt Ieſus? Were not the idolatrous Iſraelites, before ſpoken of, euery whit as bountifull,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 1.8.</note> yea more bountiful then they?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150583:94"/>What will they ſay to thoſe that offered their ſons and their daughters vnto <hi>Moloch,</hi> and ſuch like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Idols? will that proue there was any foundneſſe and vprightneſſe in them? Indeed this much may bee gathered from thence, that they had a great meaſure of loue, which made them ſo bountifull. But what kind of loue was it? a Chriſtian and well-grounded loue? nothing leſſe, but a fleſhly and diuelliſh loue, as is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant in this, that it made them ſo forward in performing the workes of the fleſh and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell. And the like may be ſaid of Papiſts long and tedious pilgrimages, and their cruell and vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall whipping of themſelues, and other ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſes; it is no maruell to ſee them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and vndergoe the ſame with all readineſſe and willingneſſe, becauſe they are things vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable by the word, and conſequently ſeruices of the fleſh and not of God: And it is an eaſie matter for a man to ſpend his riches, his ſtrength, yea and his blood alſo vpon his wicked luſts, and vngodly affections.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſeeing our nature is ſo inclinable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wickedneſſe, let vs be humbled for the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and teſtifie the truth of our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by auoiding all occaſions of euill. Are wee ſuch drie wood as will eaſily be kindled? then let vs take heed how we come too neare the fire: are wee ſuch light ſtuffe, as will ſoone bee toſſed and carried hither and thither with euery puffe? then let vs beware how wee aduenture vpon ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:150583:95"/>and ſuch companie, where the winde of falſe doctrine, or of diuelliſh counſell and perſwaſion may blow vpon vs. Men will yeeld that the fleſh is fraile: but why then will they ruſh vpon the occaſions of falling? if the fleſh bee ſo ſubiect to euill, why doe they not crucifie it by prayer, by applying the threatnings of the word to their owne ſoules, by keeping good companie, and the like?</p>
                     <p>This is it that maketh a number to fall into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, into Browniſme, into ſome ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſects, or other, that when they giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the profeſſion of the Goſpell, they finde it to bee croſſe and contrary to their corrupt and finfull nature, and therefore they are full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and gainſaying, and at length fall to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the bookes of Papiſts, or Browniſts, or the like: and then they are carried vnto their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions with ſuch eagerneſſe and violence, as a ſhip on the ſea that goes with winde and ſale. Now what is the reaſon hereof? becauſe the fleſh is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſtrongly bent, vntill it meet with an ill obiect, but then it paſſeth on amaine without any ſtop or let.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let vs bee carefull that wee doe not ruſh vpon any ſuch inducements vnto Idolatrie, or ſchiſme, or any manner of impiety; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wee ſhall be ſure to bee intrapped and inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>Oh but this is too much niceneſſe and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſitie,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                        </label> (will ſome ſay) I hope we are not ſo weake
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:150583:95"/>nor ſo ſimple, but we can chuſe the beſt, and leaue the worſt: be preſent at any popiſh worſhip, and yet keepe our hearts to God: conuerſe with any company, and yet continue honeſt men ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Haue you ſo good a perſwaſion of your fleſh?
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> certainly you doe thereby giue mee iuſt occaſion to haue an ill perſwaſion of you, and to ſuſpect that in truth you doe not much care of what reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or of what conuerſation you be. Others haue bin as well conceited of themſelues as you, and thereupon haue been bold without any calling or warrant to trauell into ſtrange countries, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, to ſee Images, and to heare Maſſes, and to vſe familiarity with men of all ſorts. But what hath been the euent thereof? they haue returned home, either of no religion, or of a falſe religion. This lamentable experience doth ſhew to be moſt true, in many young Gentlemen of the greateſt houſes in this our land, whoſe atheiſticall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane carriage ſhould bee a warning vnto others, not to preſume vpon their owne ſtrength, nor to tempt the Lord by caſting themſelues vpon the occaſions of euill.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this may ſerue for a caueat vnto vs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that when we finde our ſelues very eager and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnto any thing, wee make a ſtay, and a pauſe, examining whether the thing be lawfull &amp; good, yea or no: and if it be ſo, yet let vs ſearch whether our fleſh be not ſet a worke in that ſpiritual action which we are about: whether there bee not in it ſome mixture of corruption, and ſome caruall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:150583:96"/>or other, that maketh vs ſo nimble and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the performance of it: let vs (I ſay) looke well vnto our hearts in this behalfe; for all is not fire from the altar, that ſeemes to bee ſuch: it is a rare thing for vs to bee truly zealous of good workes; and much of our heate proceedeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from our owne fleſh, then from Gods ſpirit; and therefore when wee perceiue our violence and eagerneſſe to ariſe rather from ſome inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate luſt, then from any good and holy affection, let vs curbe and reſtraine the ſame, and beſeech the Lord to moderate our deſires, that wee may doe all our workes in meckeneſſe and modeſtie, and with that good temper which beſeemeth Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſithence there is in euery mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuch proneneſſe vnto ſin and iniquitie, this ſhould be a ſingular comfort vnto Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they finde many motions vnto euill, and much dulnes and backwardnes vnto that which is good, they need not be diſmaied hereat, if ſo bee they ſee their corruption and bee grieued for it;
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> and ſtriue againſt it.</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould Heretikes bee able to cleaue more earneſtly,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                        </label> and firmely to ſuperſtition and idolatrie, then wee can to true religion and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?</p>
                     <p>There is good reaſon for that:
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> becauſe they haue all helpes that Satan, the fleſh or the world can affoord them, and we haue all the hindrances that may bee from them all: for it pleaſeth the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:150583:96"/>Lord, that while we haue a natural life, we ſhould haue alſo naturall corruption: and albeit the fleſh bee in part crucified, yet will it ſtill rebell againſt the Spirit, and the diuell and the world will take part with it.</p>
                     <p>But what then is the difference between Gods ſeruants, and the ſeruants of the diuel,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>
                        </label> ſeeing there is in them both an vnwillingnes vnto that which the Lord commandeth, and a pronenes vnto that which he forbiddeth?</p>
                     <p>Herein ſtandeth the difference,
<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                        </label> that the godly take notice of the corruptions of their nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile them, and labour to ſuppreſſe them, not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the luſts of their fleſh, either for the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holy duties, or the practiſe of any manner of euill:
<note place="margin">Galath. 5.</note> for they haue the ſpirit in them which doth alwaies reſiſt the ſinfull motions of the fleſh, ſo that as they cannot doe the good which they would, becauſe the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, that is, againſt the regenerate part in them: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they doe the euill that ſometimes they would, becauſe the ſpirit ſtrugleth and fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the luſts of the fleſh. Now concerning wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, they are altogether fleſhly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they haue vile motions from nature, or bad ſuggeſtions from Satan, they like of them, and nouriſh and cheriſh them, and if meanes and opportunity be offered, proceed to the execution of them.</p>
                     <p>Herein then may Gods children reioyce that they are farre vnlike the limmes of the diuell, in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150583:97"/>that they <hi>mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the ſpirit,</hi>

This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke of God, for which we cannot ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently praiſe his name: and therefore we ſhould doe as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> did when the Lord had put it into his heart, and into the hearts of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to bee liberall towards the building of the Temple:
<note place="margin">1. Chro. 26.13.14.18.</note> 
                        <hi>Now therefore, our God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious name.

                     </p>
                     <p>From which words it is apparant, that it is an admirable and ſupernaturall worke to haue a well diſpoſed minde, and a well affected heart vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that concernes the worſhip of God, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:150583:97"/>his glory: to bee franke and free-hearted in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing ones ſubſtance vpon ſumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, coſtly apparell, great houſe-keeping, ſetting vp Lords of miſrule, and the like, is a thing not worth the ſpeaking of, becauſe a meere carnall man in arrogancie and vaine-glory may bee very lauiſh and prodigall to ſuch ends and purpoſes. But to haue a liberal heart for good vſes, either for the furtherance of Gods ſeruice, or for the reliefe of the diſtreſſed Saints, is a matter that we ſhould take ſpeciall notice of, and be carefull to magnifie the name of the Lord for it, and earneſtly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the continuance of it, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth in this place.</p>
                     <p>And though we be not alwaies alike, but now and then dull, and heauie, and lumpiſh, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, when it pleaſeth the Lord for our humbling to let the fleſh play it part; yet if wee ſometimes, and for the moſt part finde ſpirituall motions and affections, and from thence proceed to holy ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and actions, as occaſion and ability is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, wee haue great cauſe to bleſſe the name of God for his ſingular fauour and goodneſſe towards vs in that behalfe.</p>

<note place="margin">Iſa. 61.</note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as thoſe that in their miſeries are paſſionate, and deſperate, full of murmuring againſt God, and of fretting againſt men, cannot expect any ioyfull iſſue out of their troubles: ſo on the other ſide, they that are lowly and broken harted, much deiected and abaſed in the preſence of the Lord, and milde and peaceable in their carriage before
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:150583:99"/>men, they may be aſſured that all their ſighs ſhall end in ſongs, that all teares ſhall bee wiped away from their eyes, and that in ſtead of the ſpirit of heauineſſe, they ſhall in due time be clad with the garments of gladneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Gods ſeruants doe pray in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which is the very high way vnto ſound comfort:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>Call vpon me in the time of trouble</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and I will deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> This <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> had good experience of: for when they being in a great ſtraite,
<note place="margin">2. Chron. 14. &amp; 20.</note> had humbled themſelues by faſting and prayer, their hearts were full of ioy, and their mouthes full of the praiſes of the Lord for their wonderfull deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from their enemies. And the like may be ſaid of <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heſtor.</note> and the reſt of the Iewes in his time.
<note place="margin">Iohn 16.20.</note> And our Sauiour telleth his Diſciples, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay vnto you, that yee ſhall weepe and lament, but your ſorrow ſhal bee turned into ioy.</hi> But by what meanes ſhould they attaine vnto this? the words following doe make it manifeſt, <hi>Ask</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ye ſhall receiue,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 24.</note> that your ioy may bee full.</hi> When Chriſtians doe enioy wealth, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and eaſe, they are oftentimes made ſo dull and ſecure therby, that they haue little mind to powre out their ſoules before God in prayer: but when once they are throughly pinched and preſſed with miſeries and calamities, then they begin to renue their acquaintance with God, and ſo brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging before him abundance of holy and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayers, hee repleniſheth them with ſtore of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150583:100"/>ſweet and celeſtiall comforts.</p>
                  <p>A third reaſon hereof may bee taken from the end of Gods afflictions,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which is (as hee himſelfe teſtifieth in the booke of Deuteronomie) <hi>that hee may doe his children good in the latter end,</hi> that hee may make <hi>them partakers of his holineſſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.10.</note> and ſo by conſequent of the conſolations of his ſpirit. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God will doe his enemies a notable diſpleaſure, hee ſetteth them aloft <hi>in ſlippery places,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.</note> that ſo their fall may bee more fearefull and vnrecouerable: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo on the contrary, when hee purpoſeth ſome extraordinarie benefits vnto his ſeruants, hee will lay them full low, and afflict them full ſore, (as he did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi>) that ſo they may bee more capable of his fauours.</p>
                  <p>Here commeth to be reproued that faint-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe that is in many of Gods children in the daies of their affliction:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> who ſeeing that they haue many, and great and ſtrange croſſes lying vpon them, begin to be cleane out of heart, and out of hope, and to make theſe or the like deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; Surely I ſhall neuer winde out of theſe diſtreſſes; my ſtate is paſt recouerie, I neuer looke to ſee ioyfull day more. Theſe are baſe and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and vnbeleeuing ſpeeches, which doe diſmay the ſoule, and cauſe the parties that vſe them to deſiſt from ſeeking vnto the Lord for helpe and reliefe: and wretched is that ſorrow that driueth vs from hope and from prayer. What? can the Lord wound, and can hee not heale? can hee caſt downe, and can he not raiſe vp? can hee kill, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150583:100"/>not make aliue? ſhall our faults bee more forcible to procure his diſpleaſure, then Chriſt his merits to recouer his fauour? Away with theſe vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conceits, and diſtruſtfull thoughts and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: for he that ſaith hee ſhall neuer liue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life more, doth in effect ſay thus much, that either he is no true Chriſtian, or the Lord no true God of his word, who hath ſaid,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 97.11.</note> that <hi>light is ſowne for the righteous, and ioy for all that are vpright in heart.</hi> Why then ſhould wee not ſuſtaine our ſelues with the expectation of deliuerance to come? and why ſhould we not ſweeten our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent teares, with the hope of future comforts? The Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> preſſeth the example of the husbandman, who though his barne bee emptie, and his ſeede that he hath caſt into the earrh, not yet appearing aboue ground,
<note place="margin">Iam. 5.7.8.</note> yet <hi>he waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, vntill he receiue the former, and the latter raine.</hi> And what of this? <hi>Be ye alſo patient therefore</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and ſettle your hearts,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed all Chriſtians haue reaſon ſo to doe: for they are good ſeedſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are euermore ſowing prayers and teares in the boſome of Ieſus Chriſt: and therefore they haue a crop growing, that cannot poſſibly miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; howſoeuer it fall out vnto others, they ſhall be ſure to ſpeed well, and to haue an happie iſſue out of all their temptations.</p>
                  <p>Oh but my croſſes and trials are ſtrange and extraordinarie.

And in truth it is a great diſhonour and indignity that we offer vnto the Lord, when wee imagine that hee can doe ſomewhat for vs in ſmall and light affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but if our caſe bee any thing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that then there is no hope of helpe and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour from him: for thereby wee make the Lord ſuch a Pilot as can doe ſomewhat vpon a ſhallow riuer, where there is little or no danger: but vpon the maine Ocean, eſpecially if the Sea begin to ſwell and rage, wee dare not truſt vnto his skill. what vile and baſe vnbeleefe is this? The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> was otherwiſe affected when hee ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 46.1.2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>God is our hope, and ſtrength, a helpe in troubles ready to bee found.

                  <p>Secondly, is it ſo, that all the perplexities and anguiſhes of the righteous ſhall end in ioy? Is this a priuiledge and prerogatiue peculiar vnto them? then how wretched and wofull is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of al the vngodly ones of the world, whoſe ſorrow ſhall end in ſorrow, and who ſhall goe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150583:101"/>from their preſent paine and griefe vnto perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall tortures and torments in hell fire? let them make merrie, and bee as iocund as they will for a time, and ſeeke to put away melancholie fits, as they tearme them; they haue a crop growing, as well as Gods children: but what is that? euen a crop of ſhame, and horrour, and anguiſh, which ſhall ſeize vpon their ſoules at vnawares, and that to their euerlaſting ruine, and the vtter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bodies and ſoules for euermore. And therefore as the godly are to bee exhorted not to enuie the proſperity of the wicked, though they flouriſh for a ſeaſon; ſo are the vngodly to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed that they doe not eſteeme Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be miſerable, albeit they be in heauineſſe for a time:

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heere is matter of very great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all ſuch as are mourners in Sion, though they be weeping when others are reioycing, and faſting, when others are feaſting; yet a time ſhall come, when ſorrow and trouble ſhall flie away, and comfort and peace ſhall ſucceed in the roome thereof: God hath ſaid it, and they ſhall finde it,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:150583:102"/>that <hi>it ſhall goe well with the righteous,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſaiah 4. Pſal. 37.</note> and that <hi>the end of ſuch men ſhall be peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if we would be aſſured of this good effect of our afflictions, wee muſt practiſe theſe two rules:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to ſearch, whether the croſſes that lie vpon vs, doe come for any ſpeciall ſin of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or commiſſion, whereof we are guilty: and if wee vpon examination finde it to bee ſo, let vs with all ſpeede remoue that from before Gods eyes: otherwiſe we may be ſure, that the more he loues vs, the more hee will afflict vs. If wee bee men or women after Cods owne heart, yet if we liue in ſuch iniquities as are condemned by his word, he will ſtill purſue vs as hee did <hi>Dauid,</hi> till hee haue reclaimed vs, and healed our ſinfull ſoules of thoſe wounds that Satan hath giuen them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond rule is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that if vpon triall made wee can ſee no ſpeciall ſin which hath procured Gods correcting hand vpon vs, or at leaſt haue truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented for the ſame, if there haue been any ſuch committed by vs, then we ſhould take the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſent of God, to try our faith, &amp; to perfect our patience, and other vertues of the ſpirit in vs: and therefore we muſt poſſeſſe our ſoules in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, and labour to ſow plentifully vnto the Spirit, that ſo at length we may reape abundantly of thoſe comforts which the Lord hath treaſured vp for vs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He will certainly haue mercy vpon thee [at the voice
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150583:102"/>of thy cry]</hi> Whence this doctrine may bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that, The way to haue mercy from God, is to cry vnto God. But this point hath been han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled elſe where. See the ſecond Sermon on La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. Doct. 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When he heareth thee, he will anſwere thee.]</hi> Hence note, that wee are not more ready to aske then God is to grant our requeſts. See booke of the tenne Sermons, the fourth Doct. of the 4. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, where this point is handled.</p>

<note place="margin">1.

                     <p>Now as concerning this Church, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit,</hi> it doth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, that they had receiued the Spirit.

                     <p>But for the further clearing of this text, two Queſtions may be anſwered.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is,
<label type="milestone">

                     <p>Firſt of all,
<note place="margin">Effects of the Spirit.</note> if there bee nothing in a man but that which by nature and induſtrie may bee attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> then ſurely he hath not in him the ſpirit of God; for that is aboue nature, and worketh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall effects: in which regard the Apoſtle doth ſet the ſpirit of God in oppoſition againſt the ſpirit of the world, ſaying, <hi>We haue receiued the ſpirit, not of the world, but of God.</hi> 1.

                     <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> conſider whether there bee in thee any alteration, and change: for in regeneration, there muſt be a corruption of ſin, ſo that as ſeed in the ground, ſo ſinne in our ſoules may decay, that the new man may be raiſed vp, the ſpirit of God taking poſſeſſion of our ſoules.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.8.</note> Therefore the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh this the firſt worke of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:150583:104"/>ſpirit, that it ſhall <hi>conuince the world of ſin:</hi> which is ſo needfull, that without it Chriſt Ieſus can neuer enter into the heart: for hee promiſeth to dwell only with them,

If it doe proceed further, and come once to the heart, and to the ſtomacke and courage that is in vs, then it cutteth vs to the quicke; then doth it at once eaſt vs downe in humility vnder the hand of God, whereas when wee had to deale with men, we were as ſtout as any, and would nor ſtart for the beſt. Wee had reaſon to ſay for our ſelues, and courage to defend our ſelues againſt all them that did deale with vs: but now the ſpirit draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs into the preſence of God; it letteth vs to ſee that wee haue to doe with God, and that our ſtrength is weakeneſſe in reſpect of him.

                     <p>The third note and effect is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the bringing on forward of this work vnto iuſtification:
<note place="margin">Iuſtification.</note> for when the ſpirit hath brought vs thus farre, then doth it begin to open vnto vs a doore vnto the grace and fauour of God. It doth put into our mindes that there is mercy with God, and therefore ſtirreth vs vp to ſeeke mercy at his hands: afterward it doth let vs ſee how Chriſt ſuffered to take away the ſinnes of the world, that in the righteouſneſſe of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:150583:105"/>Chriſt, we may looke to be iuſtified before God. And this it doth not let vs ſee only, but doth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually worke a ſure perſwaſion of it in our hearts,
<note place="margin">Effects of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> and confirmeth the ſame by two notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is a ioy moſt vnſpeakeable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<note place="margin">1. Ioy. 1. Pet. 1.8. Rom. 5.2.</note> wherewith our hearts muſt needs be wholly taken vp, and rauiſhed, when we ſee our ſelues by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, of the free mercy and grace of God, redeemed from death, deliuered from hell, and freed from the fearefull condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the wicked.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is the peace of conſcience,
<note place="margin">2. Peace. Rom. 5.1. Philip. 4.6.</note> which indeed paſſeth all vnderſtanding. While ſin, and the guilt of ſinne remained, there was no peace, nor reſt, nor quietnes to be found, but feare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, terrours without, and troubles on euery ſide: but when once ſinne is nailed to the croſſe of Chriſt: when the guilt thereof is taken out of our conſciences, and the puniſhment thereof farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, then muſt needs enſue great peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is at one with vs: and for this we haue the warrant and teſtimony of the ſpirit: for fleſh and blood cannot worke in vs this holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>And hereof doth ariſe a fourth note,
<note place="margin">4. Readineſſe to doe good.</note> to wit, the life and nimblenes that is in vs to doe good: for when a man doth finde fauour from God, for the forgiuenes of his ſins, then the loue of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth him, and that ioy which hee conceiueth enforceth him, and putteth life into him for the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:150583:105"/>performance of thoſe things, which are pleaſing vnto God. Then he beginneth to finde himſelfe, not only reclaimed from euill, but alſo framed to that which is good. Then is his vnderſtanding enlightened to ſee into the myſteries of godlines, then is his iudgement reformed, ſo that he is able to diſcerne betwixt truth and falſhood, betwixt that which is good, and that which is euill.
<note place="margin">1.

This is the life of God in him:
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.18. Rom. 8.2.</note> thus he liueth that hath receiued the ſpirit, and thus he leadeth his life continually: for they that haue receiued the ſpirit, are led by the ſpirit, and doe liue accordingly,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> bringing forth the fruites of the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>But this hath frailtie ioyned with it, and men through weakeneſſe may ſoone fall: therefore if notwithſtanding that, we will know whether we ſtill retaine the ſpirit, wee muſt try ourſelues by theſe rules:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, if through infirmitie wee haue fallen,
<note place="margin">Iam. 3.1. Notes of the ſpirit after ſlips. 1. Hatred ſinne.</note> (as who doth not) and will know whether thereby wee haue loſt the ſpirit of God, or no, let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what liking or miſliking we haue of ſinne: for if wee ſtill hold our former hatred of that, and the oftener we fal, the more thoroughly &amp; deadly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:150583:106"/>hatred wee conceiue againſt it, vndoubtedly that frailty hath not as yet depriued vs of the ſpirit; for this holy deteſtation of ſin is a fruit of the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Sorrow for ſinne. 2. Cor. 7.</note> conſider how it ſtandeth with thy ſorrow: for ſo long as thy ſorrow for ſin encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, it cannot be, that the ſpirit ſhould bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in thee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,

                     <p>But the laſt is moſt certaine,
<note place="margin">4. Greater zeale in well doing. 2. Cor. 7.11.

                     <p>Now further, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit,</hi> he implieth that the ſpirit is in ſome reſpects like vnto fire; therefore if wee doe but a little conſider of the nature of fire, we ſhall a great deale better iudge of the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it will conſume things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible:
<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit whereby it reſembleth fire.

                     <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fire doth purge and purifie things:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:150583:106"/>and ſo doth the ſpirit purge vs from the droſſe of ſinne daily more and more,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.2. Act. 159.</note> that we may bee holy temples for him to dwell in.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fire giueth light euen in the darkeſt places: and ſo is the ſpirit a ſhining lampe,
<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.5.6.</note> euer giuing light vnto vs in the midſt of the darknes of this world.</p>
                     <p>And laſt of all, fire giueth heate,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and withall doth as it were put life into thoſe things which are capable of life: for whileſt a man is frozen and ſtarued, he is numbed, and as it were without life: but being brought to the fire, hee is reuiued, and cheered,
<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.13. Epheſ. 2.1.</note> and then becommeth actiue and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: euen ſo doth the ſpirit ſet vs on heate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth vs with a zeale of Gods glory, with a care of our dutie, and with a loue of all mankind; yea withal it putteth life into vs to walke in that good way which leadeth vnto life.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee what likelihood there is between the ſpirit and fire, for which cauſe it is ſometimes called fire: as Matth. 3.11. Therefore as truly and certainly as we may ſay there is fire where we ſee ſtraw or ſticks conſumed, gold or ſiluer purged, great light in darke places, or great heate and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in bodies that were benummed before: ſo truly may wee ſay, and ſo certainly may wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelues that the ſpirit of God is in vs, when wee ſee our corruptions conſumed, our ſoules purged, our hearts inlightened, and made hot in walking, and working according to that light.</p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:150583:107"/>
                     <p> The ſecond queſtion to be conſidered,

                     <p>To this it may be ſaid,
<label type="milestone">

                        </label> that becauſe the ſpirit of God commeth to, and worketh in diuers men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly, and in diuers meaſures, therefore wee muſt conſider of the diuers working of the ſpirit, and then frame our anſwere accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then there is a lighter and leſſer worke of the ſpirit,
<note place="margin">Seuerall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the ſpirit.</note> which may be quenched: as appeareth in the two kinds of grounds, Luke 8. to wit, the ſtonie and thornie ground,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which doubtleſſe felt ſome working of the ſpirit;
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.

If any would ſee the truth of this more cleerely, let him reade, Hebr. chap. 6. verſ. 1.2.3.4.5,</p>
                     <p>There is a ſecond kind of working of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,

                     <p>Thus then we ſee the queſtion anſwered: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt it be ſtrange, much leſſe offenſiue vnto vs that the Lord ſhould take ſome, and leaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; or that he ſhould work effectually in ſome, for their eternall ſaluation, and more ſlightly in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for the encreaſe of their condemnation: for thus hath God dealt euen from the beginning, and that moſt righteouſly, becauſe hee may doe with his owne what he will: Rom. 9.20.21.</p>

<note place="margin">Concerning knowledge.</note>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and his promiſes for their conſolation: whereas the knowledge of the wicked is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and cauſeth them to apply nothing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for good.</p>
                     <p>Againe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> godly mens knowledge is ſufficient to direct them both generally, and in particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: whereas the knowledge of the vngodly is onely generall.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the knowledge of the one continueth with them vnto the end; but the knowledge of the other leaueth them in the end. Therefore is the knowledge of the godly for the cleereneſſe, certainty, and ſufficiencie of it, compared to the Sunne:
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> and the knowledge of the wicked to the lightning, which is onely for a ſudden flaſh, and when it is gone, men are more dimme-ſighted then they were before. Thus wee ſee one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their iudgements.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let vs come to their affections. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is,
<note place="margin">Concerning the affections. 1. Deſire. Pſal. 78.34.</note> that the wicked do deſire the helpe and fauour of God, but the difference ſtands in the cauſe why: they ſeeke helpe onely becauſe of ſome extremitie they are in; and ſue for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God, becauſe they would bee freed from griefe: and therefore it is vſuall with them to ſay; Oh that I were out of this paine! oh, that this my ſorrow were taken from me! by which ſpeeches they ſhew, that ſo they might be at reſt and eaſe, they would little weigh of the helpe and fauour
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150583:109"/>of God: but the godly finde ſuch ſweetneſſe in his lyue, that they count it better then life it ſelfe:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.3.</note> in ſo much that for the obtaining thereof they can be content to forgoe all the pleaſures of this life,
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.4.</note> yea and to ſuffer whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to inflict vpon them.</p>
                     <p>Further, not the godly onely,
<note place="margin">2. Sorrow.</note> but the wicked alſo are grieued when they haue ſinned: but the wicked doe therefore ſorrow, becauſe their ſinne hath or will bring ſome puniſhment vpon them: and the godly ſorrow chiefly becauſe they haue offended God,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 80.7.</note> and giuen him occaſion to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his fauour from them.</p>
                     <p>The third difference is in their loue:
<note place="margin">3. Loue.</note> for though both of them doe loue God, yet it is after a diuers manner; the one of ſincerity, the other for wages onely. A poore child that is taken vp, fed, and cloathed, will loue him that doth thus feede and cloathe him: but if hee receiued no more of that man then of another, he would like him and loue him no better then another: euen ſo it is with the wicked; if their bellies be filled, their barnes ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, and they haue their hearts deſire, they loue God indeed, but onely for their bellie and their barnes. Thus did <hi>Saul</hi> loue God for his kingdom; <hi>Achitophel</hi> for his promotion; <hi>Iudas</hi> for his place of Apoſtleſhip: but what became of their loue? <hi>Saul</hi> a little afflicted, forſooke God; <hi>Achitophel</hi> ſomwhat croſſed in his deuices, and diſappointed of his hopes, hanged himſelfe; and <hi>Iudas</hi> for gaine betraied Chriſt.</p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:150583:110"/>
                     <p> Some experience of this wee may ſee among vs: Courtiers will be profeſſors, and Schollers of ripe wits will be religious, if that Courtiers may become Counſellors, and Schollers may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the chiefeſt places; but if promotion come not, then is their profeſſion forſaken, and their religion laid aſide: and yet that is not all, for either they waxe prophane in their liues, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall in their opinions. Doe the children of God loue on this manner? No, the holy Ghoſt which they haue receiued in effectuall manner, doth ſhed the ſeede of loue in their hearts,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> and doth worke in them a ſpeciall liking of his goodneſſe, and of his holineſſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.1.</note> ſo that they loue him not for his bleſſing alone, but chiefly for himſelfe: as the naturall child loueth his father naturally, and though his father beate him, yet he beareth it, and ſtill loueth him.
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.2.3.4.</note> They haue powred and infuſed into them a godly nature, ſo that they doe freely loue God their father: and though hee afflict them, or croſſe them in their deſires, yet they loue him, and in loue performe their obedience vnto him continually.
<note place="margin">Iob 13.</note> Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though hee kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> And this is the third marke or rule whereby to proue and trie our ſelues.</p>
                     <p>The laſt rule is in conſidering the effect of Gods mercies receiued.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For herein do the wicked ſhew their wickedneſſe two waies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt on the right hand, the mercies of God do worke in them a wonderfull contentation, but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150583:110"/>not ſuch as cauſeth them to returne the glory vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but rather to aſcribe it vnto themſelues: for the graces of God do puffe them vp, &amp; make them conceited in themſelues. Hereof there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a great ſecurity, which bringeth firſt neglect, and after contempt of all good meanes. On the left hand others offend, being neuer pleaſed nor contented with that they haue: nay indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, or lightly eſteeming that they haue, and ſtill deſiring new. Theſe men beſides that they are vnthankfull, they doe alſo murmure and grudge againſt God, and are neuer pleaſed with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two doe the children of God hold a middle and euen courſe, and therefore wee ſhall ſee theſe things in them. Firſt a ſight and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their wants, which cauſe them to long for the <hi>ſincere milke of the word,</hi> that thereby their wants may bee ſupplied, and their graces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: and ſo farre are they from being lifted vp with pride, that they reioyce when their pride may bee pulled downe, whether by rebukes, or threatnings, or corrections from the Lord. For they know that if <hi>Paul</hi> needed meanes of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, (2. Cor. 12.) much more doe they.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, as they deſire the word, ſo they waite vntill it pleaſe the Lord to worke further in them thereby: and this waiting is as earneſt as theirs, who hauing watched all night, do wait and looke for the dawning of the day.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as they ſee their wants,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.10.</note> ſo doe they alſo ſee the graces they haue receiued, and are for
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:150583:111"/>that time well apaid and contented therewith: and therefore as their wants doe humble them, ſo Gods graces doe comfort them: and as their wants do call vpon them to ſeek more, ſo the gifts they haue, prouoke them to be thankfull for that they haue receiued. And thus much for the laſt rule of triall. Theſe forenamed properties whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer can find in himſelfe, he may bee aſſured that the ſpirit hath wrought in him ſo effectually, as that it ſhall neuer be taken from him.</p>
                     <p>But what then? may ſuch caſt off all care? No, the Apoſtle ſaith vnto ſuch, <hi>Quench not the ſpirit.</hi> And not without cauſe: for though the ſpirit it ſelfe can neuer bee vtterly taken from them, yet doubtleſſe if pride, ſecurity, or any other ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to take place in them, the graces of the ſpirit may decay, and their cleare vnderſtanding, and comfortable feelings may be gone, ſo that in their own and others iudgements, the ſpirit may ſeeme to be quite extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Neither muſt this ſeeme ſtrange: for if the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God which was more perfectly placed in <hi>Adam,</hi> might be quite loſt, then no maruell if the graces of the ſpirit bee drowned in vs for a time. The Galathians were truly regenerated, and had receiued Chriſt into their hearts: yet their graces were ſo choked and quenched, that hee was as it were without faſhion or forme: ſo that the Apoſtle did as it were trauell againe,
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.19.</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Chriſt was faſhioned anew in them. <hi>Dauid</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vpon the committing of his ſinne was brought
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:150583:111"/>vnto that caſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> that he prayed God to <hi>create in him a new ſpirit.</hi> What, was the ſpirit quite gone? No, for by and by after he prayeth that God <hi>would not take his holy ſpirit from him:</hi> but the graces thereof were wonderfully decaied, and therefore he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that they might be renued.</p>
                     <p>But that none may abuſe this doctrine,
<note place="margin">Euils that follow vpon quenching of the ſpirit.</note> let vs conſider what puniſhments doe follow vpon the quenching of the ſpirit in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all we muſt know, that though the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bee not gotten by our labour,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yet that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the obtaining of it, and it muſt coſt vs much paines ere we can get it into our hearts: all which ſeemeth to be loſt when the graces of the ſpirit are withered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, all that peace and ioy,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is gone, with how great griefe and woe they know that in any meaſure haue taſted of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for that time they haue no heart to do good, but are made vnprofitable burthens to the earth.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſuch are in danger of falling into reproachfull euils, and ſo to procure the ſharp cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting hand of God vpon themſelues, who hath ſaid, that <hi>though hee will not take his mercies vtterly from</hi> his children, yet <hi>hee will viſit their ſinnes with the rod, and their iniquities with ſcourges:</hi> as he dealt with <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſt of all,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> when the graces of the ſpirit of God are once decayed, they cannot bee repaired but with very much ſorrow: for what a griefe will it
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:150583:112"/>be to call to mind our former tranſgreſſions; to aggrauate them by all circumſtances, to apply the terrible threatnings of the law to our ſtonie harts, and the like? The conſideration of all which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, ſhould cauſe vs to beware how we quench the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Yet here is matter of comfort alſo: for though we may ſuffer a great decay of Gods graces, yet by the rod or by the word, or by both, they ſhall be renued in vs againe.</p>

For albeit they were an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ſtiffe-necked people, yet heerein they were vehemently tempted, that they came from plenty in Egypt, to ſcarſity in the wilderneſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neither meate nor drinke for all that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, being ſixe hundred thouſand men, beſides women and children. Wherefore let vs ceaſe to wonder at this people, and in them ſee our owne corruption. For do not many amongſt vs, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the abundance which the Lord hath beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:150583:112"/>vpon Magiſtrates or Miniſters, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their duties, doe they not (I ſay) rather murmure at it, then ſhew themſelues thankefull for troubles that they are freed from, and for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie that the Lord hath giuen them to liue vpon?</p>
                     <p>True it is, that notwithſtanding the greatnes of this peoples temptation, their ſinne was very hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; for Gods mercies had been wonderfull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them euen immediatly before, and that the vnthankfulleſt of them had been driuen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.</note> yet did they wiſh to returne to their former bondage, rather then to be brought to ſuch ſtraits: but notwithſtanding the grieuouſneſſe of this their ſin, many now adaies come nothing behind them: for their eyes are ſo vpon their wants, that the want of one thing which they doe deſire, though it be but ſmall, doth more diſquiet them, then manifold bleſſings do comfort them, to make them thankfull.</p>
                     <p>But this diſcontentment we muſt bee armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt: which wee ſhall bee if wee can receiue the fauour of God for it ſelfe, though it come alone, yea though trouble doe come therewith: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, wee haue all things, and wanting it, wee haue nothing. Againe, if wee haue it, no miſery can make vs miſerable: and if wee haue it not, in greateſt proſperity we are moſt miſerable.</p>
                     <p>But the Iſraelites here dealt after a cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary manner: for the want of bread in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, being but for their bodies, did make them
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:150583:113"/>to deſpiſe their great and wonderfull deliuerance out of Egypt, which was vnto them a ſigne of their ſpirituall deliuerance. And this is the nature of all worldlings; they had rather forgoe many ſpirituall benefits, then one corporall commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: they grieue more at the loſing, and reioyce more at the hauing of wealth, then of godlineſſe.</p>
                     <p>But to returne to the point in hand, ſith murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is ſo great a ſinne, it ſhall be profitable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of ſome remedies againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Now for as much as impatiencie proceedeth from infidelity,
<note place="margin">Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</note> the remedie therof muſt be fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from faith in Gods mercies, in the merits of Chriſt, in the hope of the reſurrection, and in Gods fatherly prouidence.</p>
                     <p>Firſt (I ſay) Gods rich mercy,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and fauourable dealing with vs, being duly conſidered, cannot but worke in vs patience: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſeeing that the Lord forbeareth vs, and that when for the ripeneſſe of our ſinnes he might confound vs, hee doth rather heape bleſſings vpon vs, this cannot but bridle vs from murmuring, though all things fall not out according to our hearts deſire. Eſpecially ſeeing that the Lord will deale with vs ſtill as he did with the Iſraelites, that when ordinarie meanes failed, had extraordinary prouiſion made for them; the clouds giuing them bread, and the rocke water, to teach vs that man liueth not by bread only (as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> applieth it, Deut. 8.) but by the word of God.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond remedy is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to haue a liuely faith in the worke of our redemption, to wit, the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:150583:113"/>of our ſins, the imputation of Chriſt his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and inherent ſanctification.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then if we can ſtedfaſtly beleeue that God for Chriſt his ſake hath freely forgiuen vs all our ſinnes, and giuen his ſonne, that in him we might be bleſſed, we cannot but be aſſured,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that <hi>with him he will giue vs all things.</hi> For ſeeing ſin, which is the cauſe of all miſerie, is taken from vs, wee may bee ſure that no croſſe ſhall euer hurt vs.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if wee could beleeue that as God doth lay our ſinnes vpon Chriſt, ſo he doth impute his righteouſnes to vs, how ſhould we doubt of food or raiment, &amp;c? For by this meanes hee is made our mercifull and louing father, who is for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, able, and for will, readie to helpe vs in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. And thus doth he abide for euer, and is neuer changed.</p>
                     <p>To theſe two former,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> muſt be added the ſecond part of our redemption, namely, the ſanctification of the ſpirit, which if we feele in our ſelues, may be a great helpe vnto vs againſt impatiency: for it is a greater thing to ſanctifie a ſinner, then to worke wonders in nature. Therfore if we can beleeue in our hearts that God is able to make of ſinfull and wicked men, iuſt &amp; righteous; of whoremongers, chaſt perſons, &amp;c. and that he is able and willing to deliuer vs from all our corruptions, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſtrong by nature or cuſtome; if, I ſay, wee can giue credit vnto this, why ſhould wee euer doubt that hee will faile vs in outward things?</p>
                     <p>Further,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> if we can beleeue that God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                     <p>Another thing to ſtay our hearts vpon when murmuring doth aſſaile vs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> is faith in Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which is either generall or particular.</p>
                     <p>The generall prouidence of God muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, firſt in the creation of all things: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the preſeruation of them.</p>
                     <p>Doe wee then beleeue that the Lord made all things of nothing, and ſhall we doubt of his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to prouide for vs? When God created light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun,
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> the Moone, or the Stars: and cauſed graſſe to grow vpon the earth, before there was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raine or dew to water it, he did thereby teach vs: firſt, that we ſhould not put too much truſt in them whileſt we haue them: and againe, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then wee ſhould ſuffer hurt by the want of light, graſſe, or other ſuch things, the Lord both could and would prouide for vs without them. Yet now if wee ſhould not haue the Sunne, wee would thinke that light were taken from vs: and if wee wanted raine, wee would ſoone thinke wee ſhould neither haue graſſe, nor corne: but the Lord hath ordained theſe meanes to ſerue his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, not for himſelfe, for without them hee can eaſily helpe vs, but for our weakeneſſe, who otherwiſe could not eaſily be aſſured of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we muſt beleeue that God preſerueth
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:150583:115"/>all:
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> ſo that a ſparrow doth not fall to the ground without his prouidence, and hee hath a great care of beaſts, and fowles:
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> doth the Lord prouide for theſe, and will he not prouide for man, for whom theſe were made, and are are preſerued? Hereunto we muſt ioyne the particular prouidence of God: Hath he made our bodies, and will he not cloathe vs: hath he giuen vs life, and will hee not miniſter vnto vs food for the ſuſtaining thereof? He could prouide for the Iſraelites in the barren wildernſſe fortie yeeres together: yea he could preſerue <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> fortie daies without any meate at all: which euidently proueth that Gods bleſſing is all in all, whether there be meanes or no meanes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dauid</hi> obſerued by experience, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeed of the righteous was <hi>neuer forſaken,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> nor begged their bread:</hi> and if wee could bee righteous as then many were, wee ſhould find the ſame true in our owne experience as he did.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things well conſidered, will worke in vs a patient minde, the properties whereof are,</p>
                     <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Properties of a patient mind. Philip 4.11</note> to be contented with whatſoeuer the Lord ſendeth, alwaies acknowledging godlineſſe to be great riches: for we ought not to ſeeke great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor ſuffer our deſires to bee carried after high things:
<note place="margin">Ier. 45.4.</note> for this did the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> rebuke in <hi>Baruck.</hi> And Chriſt would haue vs to pray onely for our daily bread: which alſo was <hi>Iacobs</hi> prayer,
<note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> that he might haue food and raiment, wherewith the Apoſtle would haue vs to <hi>be content.
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> Let vs firſt ſeeke the kingdome of heauen,</hi> &amp;c. and then, if the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150583:116"/>Lord giue plenty, let vs be more thankfull and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable: if not, his fauour is ſufficient of it ſelfe, and we ſhall bee more comfortable with a little,
<note place="margin">Pſalm. 4.</note> then other, are in great abundance without that. But if we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reſt in the fauour of God, though wee want theſe outward things, it is certaine wee doe not truly eſteeme it, neither haue wee at that time any comfortable aſſurance of the remiſſion of our ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond property of a patient mind is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to giue vp it felfe vnto God, and to commit it ſelfe into his hand, waiting at all times for helpe from him, who onely is the author of all goodnes, yet neither preſcribing the meanes, nor appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the time, nor in any caſe indenting with him: for the Lord will haue the diſpoſition of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies free vnto himſelfe, to giue and beſtow, when and where, and how it pleaſeth him, and as it may moſt make for his glory: and therefore wee muſt wholly reſigne vp our ſelues vnto him. Which if we can doe, ſo mercifully doth God vſe to deale, that when we leaſt deſire outward things, then we ſhall haue them: and when wee freely giue them vp to him, he will giue them to vs againe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> gaue vnto the Lord <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne, which when the Lord did behold, hee quickly gaue him his ſonne againe: and ſo will hee deale with vs ſtill. The readieſt way to retaine life, goods, &amp;c. is to yeeld them vp wholly into Gods hands: not with this condition, that he ſhall giue them to vs againe, (for that were to mocke the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150583:116"/>Lord) but without all care to haue them, we muſt giue them to him, being heartily well content for his glory to forgo them, and then if they be good for vs, wee ſhall receiue them againe: if not, wee ſhall receiue ſome ſpirituall grace, which ſhall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupply the want of them. Yea the infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and mercy of God doth wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare herein, that ſometimes hee keepeth vs long without theſe things, becauſe that if we had them, he ſeeth that we would abuſe them, and preferre them before ſpirituall bleſſings. And ſometime the Lord, ſeeing our ſmall regard of ſpirituall things, will by the want of theſe outward things, bring vs to make greater account of them, that when wee can well want the one, and highly eſteeme the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may haue both together.</p>

<label type="milestone">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>3</label> ſith this inward touch for ſinne is a thing ſo neceſſarie, let vs hence learne to labour for it, and to keepe tendernes of heart when we baue obtained it: for that ſorrow which breaketh the heart, doth withall breake the necke of ſinne: and therefore when the Lord doth checke &amp; controle our conſciences, let vs eſteeme it as a great mercie, and not let ſuch ſtroakes paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their right vſe, but let vs goe to God and to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for helpe and direction, and then that little ſparke of the fire of God in our ſoules, being fed &amp; nouriſhed, will grow in the end to a great flame. Now that our harts may be kept alwaies tender &amp; ſenſible of thoſe checks which Gods ſpirit giueth vs, let vs vſe theſe meanes that follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let vs in our hearts the weapon of God,
<note place="margin">Meanes to get tendernes of heart.</note> euen the ſword of the ſpirit, whereby our hearts may be wounded, as often as need requireth: for vnregenerate perſons wanting that weapon, will rather defend, then ſmite themſelues when they haue offended, and euery childe of God hath ſomewhat of old <hi>Adam</hi> in him, in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150583:122"/>which regard he muſt be more carefull to vſe the ſword of the ſpirit, for the piercing of his heart when any ſinne is committed by him:
<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.8.</note> withall praying for the ſpirit of grace which will conuince the conſcience when it is guiltie, ſo that it ſhall haue nothing to ſay in defenſe of it ſelfe, but very much for the condemnation of it ſelfe: as is euident <hi>Ezec.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezeck. 36.</note> 36.27. whereby we may obſerue, that when God hath giuen his ſpirit vnto his elect, and (as it is in <hi>Ieremy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 31.</note> 31 33.) withall <hi>written his lawes in their hearts, then they ſhall remember their owne wicked waies, and their deedes that were not good, and ſhall iudge themſelues worthy to haue beene deſtroyed for their iniquities, &amp; for their abhominations.</hi> What is the reaſon they ſhould paſſe ſuch a heauie ſentence vpon themſelues? one would thinke they ſhould rather reioyce now, &amp; allow of themſelues and of their workes? ſo they doe reioyce at, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue of themſelues and their workes, ſo farre as they are ſpirituall: but they proclaime war againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their workes ſo far as either they are or haue beene carnall and ſinfull, and that becauſe the word of God, and the ſpirit of God doe beare ſway in their hearts: they are at vtter defiance with their pride and hypocriſie, and all wretched luſts that fight againſt their ſoules: being neuer ſo much tormented with thoſe ſinnes, as when they haue attained to a great meaſure of humilitie, and of ſinceritie. He that is moſt lowly is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moſt vexed with his pride, and he that is moſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and true hearted, is moſt of all troubled with the guilefulnes and deceitfulnes of his owne heart, becauſe the word and the ſpirit working together doe cauſe him both more clerely to ſee, and more throughly to hate thoſe corruptions, than euer hee did before he had attained to that meaſure of grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we muſt not content our ſelues when once we haue gotten the word and ſpirit of God within vs, but we muſt ſtill ſtriue to keepe our hearts humble and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150583:122"/>lowly: for otherwiſe we ſhall not feele the ſtrokes of the word and ſpirit of God; therefore it is ſaid <hi>Iſay.</hi> 30.20.21.)
<note place="margin">Iſa. 30.</note> that when the Lord had dieted his people a while <hi>[giuing them the bread of aduerſitie, and the water of affliction]</hi> and thereby taken downe the pride and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneneſſe of their hearts, that then <hi>[their eares ſhould heare a word behind them, ſaying, this is the way walke in it, &amp;c.</hi> that is when they were thus humbled, as ſoone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they had committed any offence, they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently haue a blow vpon their hearts for it, and be full of feare and anguiſh: though no man in the world tell them of it, yet the word in their hearts will be like a good guide that is ſtill following a little child, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, this is not the right way, leaue it; there is the right way, walke in it: but many haue hearts peſtered with pride, and luſt, and couetouſneſſe, and yet goe a whole moneth, nay, many monethes and yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and neuer feele any rebuke in their conſciences. How comes this to paſſe that others are full of griefe and full of teares for their ſinnes, and they are neuer troubled for them? is it beauſe there is greater vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in them, then there is in others? No ſurely it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue a more blind minde, and a more proud and ſenſeleſſe hart then others haue: for the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any one is, the more often ſhall he heare the voyce of the ſpirit, checking him when hee goeth out of the way, &amp; moouing him to turne again into the right way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we muſt eſpecially beware of preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous ſins: for if we liue therein our hearts will ceaſe to ſmite vs, or at leaſt we ſhall be ſenſeleſſe of theſe ſtrokes: as may be ſeene in the caſe of <hi>Dauid:</hi> when he had cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment and numbred the people (which were but infirmities) forthwith his conſcience rebuked him, and he was humbled before the Lord: but when he had committed adulterie, and murder, either the checkes of his conſcience were none at all, or elſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150583:123"/>they were ſo weake,
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.</note> that hee had no ſenſe nor feeling thereof: ſo that <hi>Nathan</hi> was driuen to fetch about (as it were) and to vſe all the art that might be, to make him ſee his offences, and paſſe ſentence againſt himſelfe for the ſame. Let vs therefore by his example learne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how we preſumptuouſly ſinne againſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, eſpecially in palpable and groſſe offences, leaſt our mindes being by degrees blinded, and our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by little and little corrupted, we become in the end very blocks and ſtones, and haue our conſciences ſo darkened, that they will not accuſe vs, or our hearts ſo benummed, that they will not be mooued with the ſtroakes of God, and with the checks of his holy ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After that he had numbred the people.]</hi> Heere is his ſpeciall ſinne, that he numbred his ſubiects, which may ſeeme to be no ſuch great matter, for which God ſhould ſo plague the land: and if there had bene that meaſure of hypocriſie in <hi>Dauid,</hi> as there is in many of vs, he would haue pleaded thus for himſelfe: What need I to be ſo troubled for this? and what reaſon is there why God ſhould proceede ſo ſeuerely againſt me for the ſame? did not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> holy men of God, number the people in their daies, and that warrantably? and why then may not I doe the like, hauing more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute authoritie ouer them then they had? but his heart ſtaied him from all ſuch reaſoning of the matter; and told him, that though hee did the ſame action which they did, yet the manner of doing thereof was diuers; he performed it not in obedience to God (as they did) but in pride and hautines of minde, in regard of the multitude and ſtrength of his ſubiects: before he eſteemed Gods name a ſtrong tower for his defence, but now what need he runne crying vnto God? he had ſo many ſouldiers and valiant warriours in his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he could make his part good againſt any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren power whatſoeuer. Thus was his heart lifted vp
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150583:123"/>vnto vanitie, when it ſhould haue bene lifted vp to God in thankfulnes: and therefore was he ſo humbled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had an ill affection,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> and a wrong end in a good action. Whence ariſeth this doctrine,
<note place="margin">God looketh into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our doing.</note> That it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for to forbeare things that are euill, and to make conſcience of groſſe ſinnes, but men muſt doe lawfull things lawfully, and performe good workes in a good manner: otherwiſe the Lord may and will puniſh them for doing lawfull things, aſwell as for vnlawfull things. This may be ſeene in that great enditement which Chriſt brings againſt the old world: <hi>They did eate,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.38.</note> and drinke, marry, and giue in marriage.</hi> A naturall man would haue thought there could be no hurt in theſe: if they had bene charged with whoredome, murder, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, or the like, they had bene matters of ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but for thoſe before named, what fault can be found with them? Indeed the things in themſelues are very warrantable, but the manner of performing them, doth either make or marre them:
<note place="margin">Iude. 12. 1. Tim. 44.5.</note> to eate and drinke without feare, without prayer, and thankſ-giuing, as if the creatures were our owne, and nor the Lords, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the bleſſings of God to ſurfetting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c: theſe and the like corruptions, doe turne ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking into ſinne, which in themſelues are not onely allowable, but alſo neceſſarie. The like may be ſaid concerning marriage,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> it is a ſanctified ordinance of God vnto thoſe that vſe it holily: but then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very ſinfull and hatefull vnto the Lord,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.2.</note> when the Sonnes of God doe ioyne with the daughters of men, and profeſſors are yoaked with Infidels, for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or commoditte, or any ſuch carnall reſpect: yet that is a horrible ſinne, too too common among ſuch as profeſſe Chriſtianitie, that they make no ſcruple of matching their children with thoſe, whome they know by their workes to be as yet the children of the diuell; and ſo in other matters, if they can proue them once to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150583:124"/>be in themſelues lawfull, they make no conſcience of the meanes they vſe, nor of the end they propoſe in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of them.</p>
                  <p>The like is alleaged by our Sauiour againſt the <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 17.28.</note> as againſt thoſe of the old world, viz: that <hi>they bought and ſold, and built</hi> in couetouſneſſe, pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, as if they had bene euer to dwell vpon the earth, not caring what craft and fraud they vſed, nor what ſnares and grins they laid for men,

<note place="margin">How we may attaine to earneſtneſſe in asking pardon.</note> which <hi>Dauids</hi> example directeth vs vnto: Firſt, let vs labour that our hearts may thorowly ſmite vs, and that our conſciences may euermore checke vs when we doe offend: for whereſoeuer there is the checke of conſcience,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it will make the party grow not onely to hartie confeſſion, but alſo to earneſt petitions for grace and fauour. The greater therefore is their follie, who when the Lord doth ſtrike their drowſie conſciences for any wickedneſſe committed by them, will preſently betake themſelues to merry company, &amp; ſo by ieſting, and laughing, and drinking, and ſporting, ſeeke to driue away their melancholie fit, as they call it: but God mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with them accordingly: for when they will not take benefit by that mercifull warning which he giueth them, they commonly fall to maruellous hardnes of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150583:126"/>heart, and after breake foorth into ſome horrible ſinne, which ouerwhelmeth them with ſhame and confuſion. Let vs therefore obſerue when the Lord ſmiteth our hearts, and with <hi>Peter</hi> get out of company ſpeedily, and lament bitterly, that ſo we may turne the rebukes of our ſoules into holy requeſts, that the Lord would for giue vs, and not enter into iudgement with vs for our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous prouocations againſt his Maieſtie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when ſinne is ſo odious vnto vs, that our hearts doe condemne vs for it, then let vs ſtriue to be perſwaded that it is pardonable, yea and that it ſhall be pardoned vnto vs: that though we deſerue to be throwne out of ſeruice, becauſe we haue dealt ſo fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet ſeeing we are Gods ſeruants, he will not goe to extremities with vs, but deale as a father with his owne children, this ancor of hope we had need ſtill to hold faſt by: for if we be not in ſome good meaſure reſolued, that we ſhall finde the Lord gratious, and that we our ſelues are not hypocrites, but ſuch as to whom mercy belongeth, we ſhall preſently giue ouer prayer: for who would ſeeke vnto a Chirurgion to cure him, of whom he is afraid leſt he ſhould wound him, in that be hath cauſe and abilitie ſo to doe? Therefore hold this for a firme ground, once Gods childe, and euer: once his ſeruant, and neuer his enemie: in which regard we may come with confidence vnto him, and ſay, Lord, I am vnworthy to be called thy ſonne, yet art thou my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Father: I haue done thee ill ſeruice, yet am I thy poore ſeruant ſtill: and though I be bad now, yet time hath bene when I haue bin better, &amp; done better: when I haue praied in ſecret, and humbled my ſoule, and ſhedde teares for my ſinnes in priuate, and haue had an vtter deteſtation of thoſe euils, which now through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of my nature I haue fallen into, and therefore Lord be pacified towards me, and put out of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the treſpaſſe of thy ſeruant. If any one want theſe teſtimonies of Gods loue towards him, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150583:127"/>of his loue towards God, when affliction ouertaketh him for his ſinnes, he will either flee from the Lords preſence, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, or if he aduenture to come vnto him, his prayers will deſcend as plummets of lead vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and Sathan and his owne conſcience will be readie to accuſe him, and to ſay, what haſt thou to doe with God? he <hi>heareth not ſinners:</hi> thou ſhall rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his vengeance, then obtaine his fauour by thy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; and becauſe thou haſt bene his enemie hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he will ſhew himſelfe to be thine now: and becauſe thou haſt caſt his word behind thy backe, he will ſhut out thy cries, that they ſhall not haue any acceſſe vnto him. Which vncomfortable newes, will be as a dart to ſtrike thorow the liuer of an hypocrite, and as a two ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſword to pearſe his ſoule: and therefore let vs all labour to be ſtrongly ſetled in this point, that we are Gods ſeruants, that ſo we may be feruent and firie in our prayers, and not be ſo daunted as ſinners are when the hand of God is vpon them.</p>

<note place="margin">Ioſhua. 7.</note> hee might thereby (as he imagined) inrich himſelfe, and the matter neuer be knowne: but was not that the ruine of himſelfe &amp; his houſhold? In like manner <hi>Ieroboam</hi> eſteemed it a wiſe and ſafe way for him to ſet vp the <hi>Calues,</hi> that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might worſhip at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and ſo not fall from him, to ioyne againe to the houſe of <hi>Dauid:</hi> he accounted this a ſurer courſe to eſtabliſh his throne, then for him to reſt on Gods promiſe: but did he not get exceeding diſhonour and vtter ruine heereby? in ſo much that when the Lord will ſet foorth a notable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate and firebrand of hell, he doth deſcribe him by this, that he was like <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſinne: and whereas he hoped by this meanes to ſet vp himſelfe and his ſeed for euer, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them through his ſinnes to be ſwept away as dung from the face of the earth.

We would eſteeme it a great madneſſe, if we ſhould ſee a man, his barnes being full of corne, to ſet fire on the thatch, and to ſit by and laugh to behold all turned into a flame: and yet certainely this is not ſo great a madneſſe as for one to fire his ſoule with ſinne: for all the friends and meanes that the world affordeth cannot quench this flame, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer this loſſe, as they may the other: and therefore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150583:128"/>they are the fooles of the world, that are the ſinners of the world: and there is no ſuch frenſie, as for a man to prouoke his Creator: and whatſoeuer applauſe wicked perſons haue for a ſeaſon, yet at length all the world ſhall ſee, and they themſelues ſhall feele, that they haue beene notorious fooles: <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.11.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, is it ſo that the greateſt ſinners are the verieſt fooles? then here is matter of ſingular conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Gods ſeruants, that are vilified and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and accounted ſillie and ſimple, euen for this, that they carefully decline from the waies of ſinners, though in ſhew neuer ſo pleaſant and profitable: and conſcionable, walke in the paths of righteouſneſſe, though neuer ſo rough and dangerous: let vaine men ſpeake their pleaſure of them, and count and call them the fooles of the world, yet God eſteemeth and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth otherwiſe of them.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150583:129"/>needs take vpon him the office of the High-prieſt alſo, and ſo went into the Temple of the Lord, to burne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe vpon the Altar of incenſe; but what came of this preſumptuous fact of his? When the admonition of the Prieſts of the Lord would not preuaile with him, but he grewe wroth with thoſe that withſtoode him, the Lord louing him, did forthwith ſmite him with Leproſie, and ſo he was driuen to liue apart all his life long, that ſo the hautineſſe of his heart might bee throughlie cured. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. The like may be ſeene in <hi>Paul;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> who albeit he were a man of wonderfull graces, &amp; had beene conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exerciſed with many and great afflictions, ſo that he had no great need of further humbling, as we would haue thought, yet had he Satan turned looſe vpon him, to buffet him, and to beat him blacke and blew as it were, that ſo hee might not bee lifted vp with the multitude and excellencie of the reuelations that he had receiued. Hee had beene in the third heauen, and was indued with exceeding rare gifts: and the Lord knew, that if he were not taken downe, hee would bee very conceited of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and then all had beene loſt: he would be vnfit to receiue or doe good, altogether vnprofitable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, and robbe God of his honour, and men of their due: and therefore to preuent this, hee giueth Satan li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to worke vpon his originall corruption, and to exerciſe him with ſtrange temptations, which was a ſpeciall preſeruatiue againſt pride, and loftineſſe of minde.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, wee may note in the 8. chap. of <hi>Deuteronomie, verſe</hi> 2. what a great adoe the Lord had with his people, the children of Iſrael, to helpe them, againſt this vile corruption that was in them: hee was driuen to keepe them fortie yeeres in the wildernes, and there to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them with manie and grieuous croſſes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all to <hi>humble them,</hi> as there it is ſaide: and certainly, if fewer and eaſier afflictions would haue done
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150583:130"/>it, the Lord would neuer haue handled them ſo rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and ſharplie; for <hi>mercie pleaſeth him, neither doeth hee afflict willinglie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micah. 7. Lament. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why the pride of mens hearts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily bee remooued, is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it doth wonderfully harden them, and makes them euen like a Flinte: ſo that they are verie hardly wrought vpon, either by inſtructions, or by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. This is euident in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that diuine dreame that God had ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,
<note place="margin">Dan. 4.24.</note> and the holy inſtructions and exhortations that <hi>Daniel</hi> had giuen him, after his interpretation thereof; yet continued in his arrogancie ſtill, and was full of boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and bragging: in ſo much that the Lord was faine to ſtrippe him of his wittes, of his kingdome, of his ſoode, of his apparell, and of the ſocietie of mankinde, and to cauſe him, euen for ſeuen yeares together, to liue as a beaſt, among the beaſts of the fielde: and all little enough to take downe the ſtoutnes and loftines of his finfull heart.
<note place="margin">Dan. 5.20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as pride maketh men vnteachable, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of good by any meanes that others can vſe, ſo doth it make themvnable to vſe any means themſelues, for the humbling of their ſoules: for proud men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not examine, and iudge themſelues, becauſe they are wiſe in their own eyes, and haue an high conceit of their owne doings: they cannot pray, becauſe they haue no promiſe to builde vpon, nor any heart to humble their ſoules before the Lord, as all that will ſpeede well with him muſt doe:
<note place="margin">2. Chron. 11. Iam. 4.8.</note> they cannot labour in a calling for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake: becauſe they onely ſeeke and ſerue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in whatſoeuer they doe: in a word, they cannot applie themſelues to vſe any of thoſe holie remedies that God hath ordained, for the ſubduing and maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the pride, and haughtineſſe of their wicked hearts; and therefore it muſt needs be concluded, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150583:130"/>this dangerous ſicknes is very hardly cured. And if we haue yet any doubt hereof, let experience teach vs the truth of this point: for if wee obſerue it in our ſelues or others, we ſhall find, that thoſe that haue had moſt heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings, and ſhed moſt bitter tears, and gone through moſt fearfull temptations, and moſt grieuous diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, haue yet ſtill a great deale of pride in them, which is ready vppon euery occaſion to manifeſt it ſelfe, vnto their griefe and the offence of others.</p>
                  <p>Which maketh firſt of all for the terrour of all proud and arrogant men,

<note place="margin">Prou. 16.5.18.</note> that <hi>all the proud in heart are an abomination vnto the Lord:</hi> though <hi>hand ioyne in hand, they ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.</hi> And againe, <hi>Pride go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before destruction, and an high minde before the fall.</hi> And in the 119.

                     </gap>erely will God manifeſt his heauie diſpleaſure againſt them, as he did againſt <hi>Phàraoh, Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, Herod,</hi> and ſuch other loftie ſpirits as they were.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> let this be an inſtruction vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, that if they would not haue their maker to loath them, and to fight againſt them, they muſt labour to abhorre all loftines of minde, and ouer-weening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites of themſelues, and be content that the Lord ſhould keepe them in humilitie by whatſoeuer meanes he thinketh beſt: the godly begin to thinke much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150583:131"/>times that they are afflicted euery morning; that they are exerciſed with wants, with ſickneſſes, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces and the like: but better is it to vndergoe ſome of theſe, or all of theſe, though it be all our life long, ſo we be made more lowly thereby, than to ouerflowe with great plentie and varietie of outward things, and in the meane time to be peſtered with that venemous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of pride and ſelfe-conceit. Therefore was it that <hi>Paul</hi> doeth profeſſe that hee would <hi>reioyce in infirmities, in reproaches,
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.10.7.</note> in neceſſities, in perſecutions, &amp;c:</hi> becauſe he knewe they were excellent preſeruatiues againſt his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe men are readie to thinke that there is not in them ſuch ſtore of pride, as that they greatly neede Gods medicines to cure them of it, or if they doe ſee their pride, they are readie to ſit downe diſcouraged, as if it were vnpoſſible to get the better of it, therefore will it not be amiſſe to ſet downe ſome fruits and effects of pride, whereby it may be diſcerned, and ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and helpes againſt it, by vertue whereof it may be cured.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt point,
<note place="margin">Fruites of pride.</note> it were an infinite worke to reckon vp all the effects of pride, and therefore I will onely touch ſome few of the principall,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whereby we may be led to a ſight of the reſt:
<note place="margin">Prou. 13.10.</note> And the firſt of them ſhall be that whereof <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>Onely by pride doeth man make contention:</hi> many there are that doe ignorantly imagine they were neuer proud in all their life; but let them conſider better of the matter; did they neuer brawle nor contend with any in all their life? if they did, certaine it is that they were proud: for looke how much contention there is, ſo much pride there is in euery man. Which may be an euident argument to proue that this ſinne doeth greatly ſway euery where: for if we looke into moſt families, and euen into thoſe of the pureſt ſort (who thinke themſelues moſt free
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150583:131"/>from pride) ſhall we not finde many iarres betwixt hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife; betwixt maiſter and ſeruants, betwixt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters, betwixt neighbour and neighbour? this is ſo palpable that none can denie it; and therefore let not men deceiue themſelues, but ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and bewaile the wretched hautines of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Another fruit of pride is, impatiencie vnder croſſes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or loſſes, or indignities that doe befall vs: for when we are diſcontented at that eſtate and condition, wherein we are, we euidently expreſſe our diſlike of Gods go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, as if he did not diſpoſe of things aright, and as if we could order matters in a better ſort, if they were in our hands: and is not that monſtrous pride to thinke our ſelues wiſer than God, and to cenſure him for his proceedings?</p>
                  <p>Againe, this is an euident token that men are proud,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when they are readie to ſcorne at an admonition, or a reprooſe that is giuen vnto them, for that argueth that they haue a verie good opinion of themſelues and of their actions, when they cannot abide that anie ſhould finde faulte with them, or goe about to reforme them. <hi>Dauid</hi> was otherwiſe affected,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 12.13. Pſal. 51.</note> when the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> came vnto him with a ſharpe reprehenſion, and when <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>igall</hi> met him with a wiſe admonition. And <hi>Iob</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this as an argument of his vprightneſſe,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.32.</note> that hee durſt not <hi>contemne thè iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> No, not <hi>of his Maide ſeruant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 31.13.</note> if they had any matter to obiect againſt him: and therefore let ſuch as are enraged, or imbitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered againſt their reproouers or admoniſhers, knowe, that they are farre from that modeſtie and meekeneſſe of ſpirit that was in theſe holie men of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtlie, this is a ſure note of pride,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> when men doe much regard earthly things, and promiſe vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a kinde of happineſſe in the enioyment thereof:
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.17.</note> in which regard the Apoſtle willeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to <hi>charge
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150583:132"/>rich men that they be not high minded, and that they doe not truſt in vncertaine riches:</hi> Implying thereby, that ſo much confidence as there is in wordlie ſubſtance, ſo much high-mindednes there is in the parties ſo addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The more men truſt in God, the more humble they will be, but the more they truſt in their wealth, the more high-minded they will bee. If men would trie themſelues by this touch-ſtone, they ſhould eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne abundance of pride in themſelues: for who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is there but doeth thinke himſelfe the better and ſafer for the very hauing of earthlie things? and who doth not iudge his caſe more miſerable, meerly for the want of theſe deceitfull vanities?</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore ſifte our owne hearts, and by theſe and the like fruites of pride, learne to iudge what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this poyſoned ſappe there is within vs. And then perceiuing how liable wee are vnto many fearefull ſtroakes of God by reaſon thereof, let vs carefully vſe theſe remedies following againſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let vs often ſearch and trie our owne hearts, and workes by the right rule,
<note place="margin">Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pride.</note> that is, by the holy law of God: for none are lifted vp, but ſuch as doe not knowe themſelues: for if wee rightly conſidered what we are, and what our actions are, it would take downe all that fooliſh conceitednes, that is naturallie ingrafted in vs, and cauſe vs to ſay with the Publican, <hi>Lord bee mercifull to mee a ſinner:</hi> and with Paul, <hi>Miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliuer mee from the bodie of this death!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 18.13. Rom. 7.24.</note> hee was <hi>aliue;</hi> that is, thought himſelfe aliue, and in verie good caſe, <hi>before the law came,</hi> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinced him of his wretched corruptions, hee was euen as a blinde man that feares nothing, though a man came running vpon him with a ſharpe ſword, or he were ready to fal down viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an high and dangerous rocke, he would neuer be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the matter, nor one whit moued, becauſe hee ſees not that hee is in any danger: ſuch was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150583:132"/>ſuch is the ſtate of euery vnregenerate man: but when Gods law is once preſſed vpon the conſcience, by the liuely working of the holie Ghoſt, it inlightens the minde, and makes men ſee their owne ſinfulnes, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, which is an excellent meanes to kill all proud and loftie conceits. If therefore we deſire to be ridde of this hatefull and hurtfull companion, I meane pride, let vs often and earneſtly examine our ſelues by this ſtraight rule of Gods law: we are giuen to try our ſelues often by examining whether we be not better than ſuch a man, or ſuch a woman, but this is a falſe and a deceitfull rule: for a man may be better than ſuch and ſuch, and yet be ſtarke naught.</p>
                  <p>But the proud fleſh will be readie to obiect, and ſay,

                  <p>The ſecond is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> often to bring our hearts into Gods preſence by prayer &amp; thankſ-giuing, for that will make vs acquainted with that holines which is in the Lord, and then we cannot but ſee and acknowledge that vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which is in our ſelues. This was it that made <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> the father of Beleeuers, and the moſt excellent of all the Patriarks,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.27.</note> to confeſſe, that <hi>he was but duſt and aſhes:</hi> this was it that cauſed <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> a maruellous holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

And on the contrarie, we may boldly conclude, that they that doe not vſe reuerently and faithfully to call vpon the Lord, are proud and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and arrogant perſons, and neuer yet knewe what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150583:134"/>true lowlines meant, where there are many and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayers, there is much humilitie: where there are fewe and weake prayers, there is little humilitie: where there are no faithfull prayers at all, there is no humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at all.</p>
                  <p>A third helpe againſt pride is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> diligence in ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling:
<note place="margin">Eccl. 1.13.</note> for <hi>labour and trauell</hi> (as the wiſe man ſaith) <hi>are appointed vnto the ſonnes of men to humble them thereby.</hi> As for idle perſons, they are alwaies proud and conceited: <hi>A ſluggard is wiſer in his owne eyes,
<note place="margin">Prou.</note> then ten men that can render a reaſon,</hi> for ſuch kind of people hauing nothing to buſie their heads about, are very readie (Sathan helping them forward) to thinke of their owne worth, to imagine high things of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſo to build <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If then we would not be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage vnto this vile ſinne of pride, let vs apply our ſelues diligently vnto the workes of our ſeuerall vocations; and that for conſcience ſake and in obedience vnto God; not for filthy lucre ſake, of for enuy, or the like, for if we labour &amp; toyle neuer ſo much for worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, we ſhall not be rightly humbled thereby, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puffed vp in our fleſhly mindes.</p>
                  <p>A fourth remedie is,

                  <p>This we ſee proued in this text, where God dealeth with <hi>Dauid</hi> as a father with his owne ſonne: Firſt, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him chuſe his owne rod, when of neceſſitie he muſt be corrected: Secondly,
<note place="margin">The time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, this point was briefly handled.</note> he giueth him warning before hand, that the plague might not ouertake him on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which would wonderfully haue diſcomforted him: Thirdly, he telleth him how long it ſhould continue, ſo that he was ſure three daies would be the longeſt. Which ſerueth firſt for ſingular comfort vnto Gods children that doe bewaile their ſinnes,
<label type="milestone">

And further, if they ſtriue to humble their hearts before the Lord, though they haue not the choyce of their particular ſcourge, yet it ſhall be as well with them in effect: for although at firſt they thinke the rod very ſmart, and euery blow two, yet when they are growne to be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger men in Chriſt, they ſhall be driuen to confeſſe, that if they had choſen their owne rods, there could haue
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150583:137"/>beene none in the world ſo fit for them as thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord hath ſcourged them: So that they ſhall be able not onely to ſay with the Prophet, <hi>It is good for me that I haue beene afflicted;</hi> but good for me that I was whipped with theſe and theſe rods, yea and that I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thus many ſtrokes from the Lords mercifull hand. No croſſe could haue beene inuented to doe me more good, then pouerty, or diſgrace, or ill neighbours, or any the like, according as Gods ſeruants are ſeuerally tried. If God ſhould haue put it to <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Iacobs</hi> choyſe, they would rather haue parted with any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, then with their children, that were as deare vnto them as their life: but when they ſaw Gods end in trying them that way, when <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ſpared, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> aduanced, and made an inſtrument of humbling his boiſterous brethren, and of releeuing his father and all his familie, beſides many others, then they muſt needs acknowledge that it was fitteſt for them to be croſſed in their children, and that Cods waies are the beſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we may iudge of them for a while.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,

If <hi>Haman</hi> might haue beene the chuſer, of all other miſeries he would not haue choſen that which befell him: to wit, that <hi>Mordecai</hi> his enemie ſhould be aduanced and honoured, and that by himſelfe, who did beare him ſuch deadly hatred for that he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine honour and reuerence from him: what an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torment muſt this needs be vnto his heart, that <hi>Mordecai</hi> now ſhould ride, and he goe by him on foot? that now he muſt bow the knee to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> that would ſo faine haue had <hi>Mordecai</hi> to doe it to him? that the gallowes that was by him prepared for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> muſt now ſerue for himſelfe? &amp;c. This muſt needs be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150583:137"/>torture vnto him: and this ſhall befall all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners: What they are moſt loth to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, that ſhall light vpon them, and that at vnawares when they leaſt thinke of it, and ſhall continue with them, and neuer leaue them till it haue either turned them vnto God, or brought them vnto hell, the place of all ſuch rebrobate ſinners. And that we may apply this to the preſent occaſion, are there not many that are horribly afraid of the peſtilence? yea farre more then they are of ſinne which bringeth it: in ſo much that they abſent themſelues from Sermons, and from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers, leſt they ſhould be infected. Are there not very many (I ſay) that are poſſeſſed with ſuch feares? Let them looke to it: for of all other ſtrokes the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is likely to fall vpon them: if it were a ſword in the hand of the Pope, or of Sathan, then it ſtood them vpon to beware of Gods ordinances: but ſeeing none but Atheiſts will denie but it is ordered by Gods ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand, they take a bad courſe to eſcape his ſtroke: for where can they hide themſelues, but he will finde them out? And whither can they flee from his all-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence?</p>
                  <p>He can take away the infection where it is, and bring it euen in a moment where it is not: and therefore goe where they can, they goe in continuall danger: for where is the ſword of God moſt likely to ſmite, but where he is moſt diſpleaſed, and where there is moſt prophaneneſſe, and greateſt contempt of the meanes of ſaluation? therefore if they would eſcape, let them fall downe before the Lord, and humble themſelues as <hi>Dauid</hi> did: and not be ſo much afraid of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that haue the plague, as of ſinne that brings the plague: and runne not ſo much from the occaſion of this ſickneſſe (though all good care muſt be had that way) as from the cauſe: which if we can doe, then either God will ſpare vs, and exempt vs from this ſtroke, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:150583:138"/>elſe giue vs comfort vnder it, and deliuerance from it by life or death: making it a meanes vtterly to kill ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, which all his ordinances could but onely weaken: and who would be afraid of ſuch a cure? what child of God would not be more glad to ſit on a throne in heauen (though he be called thereto by a boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous meſſenger) than to be in a priſon heere on earth? to be where he ſhall be quite freed from ſinne and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and temptation, and haue all happineſſe aboue that which his heart can deſire, rather than to be continually turmoyled heere in the world, and euery day to taſte of new tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150583:139"/>vnto him, and biddeth him conſider, and determine which of them hee would moſt willingly vndergoe.</p>
                  <p>Now followe the euents that enſued both vpon the ſinne that <hi>Dauid</hi> committed, and the meſſage that God for the ſame directed vnto him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt whereof, was the great diſtreſſe wherewith hee was perplexed, which he bemoned to the Prophet, telling him that he was <hi>in a wonderfull ſtrait.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond was the choyſe that he made,
<note place="margin">Verſe 14.</note> abſolutely paſſing ouer the famine, without ſo much as ſpeaking of it, as knowing it to bee incomparablie the ſharpeſt ſcourge of the three: (for the Scripture faith, that they that are ſlaine by the ſword, are better then they which are killed with hunger) and rather alſo ſubmitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Peſtilence,
<note place="margin">Lament. 9.</note> which was more immediately the ſword of God, from whom he expected mercie and fauour, then to the violence and ſword of man: in whome what elſe in ſuch a caſe is to be found, but cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cltie and fierceneſſe?</p>
                  <p>The third was the execution of that plague of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence,
<note place="margin">Verſe 15.</note> which he had yeelded himſelfe vnto: which is declared as well by the manner, as the miniſter of it: it being in ſo ſhort a time, as in three dayes ſpace, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thorough the whole Land, from North to South, and (though not affirmed, yet implied) from Eaſt to Weſt, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> onely excepted, as may appeare by the circumſtance of the Text: and in this time ſeuenty thouſand being deſtroyed; which ſtroke was inſlicted by the hand of an Angell, whome God had therevnto appointed, as miniſter and executioner of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The laſt was,
<note place="margin">Verſe 16.</note> the ceaſing and ſtay of this plague, euen then when the ſtroke was lighting vpon <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to haue deſtroyed it. And hereof are aſſigned two cauſes: the one, and that the principall, was the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: to whom (for our better apprehenſion of his prouidence) is aſcribed an humane paſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150583:139"/>which properly befalleth not him, becauſe hee cannot but doe euery thing abſolutely well, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie at any time bee wearie of well-doing: neither is hee ſubiect to perturbations, becauſe he is free from all manner of corruptions. But hee is ſaid to repent, when hee withholdeth that which he condicionallie promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, or threatneth, or deſiſteth from that which he had begun to doe, ſithence men many times breake off their proceedings, with diſlike of the beginnings thereof, and their not doing of that which they ſaide, argueth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly that they are ſorrie, for ſaying that which nowe they minde not to doe.</p>
                  <p>The other cauſe, yet of an inferiour nature, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent (as wee call it) was the prayer of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 17.</note> whereby hee obtained the preſeruation of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and the reſt of the people, and herein hee offereth himſelfe to be ſmitten, that they might be ſpared, with acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hee was the offender, and they in this matter altogether innocent.</p>
                  <p>Verſe 14. <hi>And</hi> Dauid <hi>ſaid, I am in a wonderfull ſtrait]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine that hence ariſeth, is plaine: <hi>viz.</hi> that</p>
                  <p>Sinne brings men into great diſtreſſes, and into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous ſtraits.</p>
                  <p>It is the proper nature of wickedneſſe,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> to encomber and caſt men into perplexities:
<note place="margin">Sinne brings men into ſtraits.</note> neither will God ſpare his owne people, when they take libertie in prouoking his maieſtie; but either they ſhall be ſtraited in their owne hearts, or elſe in regard of outward calamities, or both: and though the Lord will not condemne them, yet will he afflict them. <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> was ſo fooliſh, that he would make affinitie with <hi>Ahab:</hi> and leſt he ſhould breake off that league of friendſhip that was betweene them, he would aduenture (contrary to the expreſſe word of the Lord) to goe againſt <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi> to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with him: now was not he in an exceeding great ſtraight, when the maine force of the battle was bent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150583:140"/>againſt him, being ſuppoſed to be the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning whom a command was giuen to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines by the King of <hi>Aram,</hi>

<note place="margin">2. King. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>for helping the wicked, and louing them that hated the Lord,</hi> he yet ioyned with <hi>Iehoram</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>Moab:</hi> but was his ſucceſſe any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then before? No ſurely: for howſoeuer they had the victorie ouer the <hi>Moabites</hi> with much difficultie, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that was effected, he was in a greater ſtraight, then when he went againſt <hi>Ramoth Gilead:</hi> for there his owne perſon onely was endangerd: but heere both he and his people, together with two Kings and their armies beſides, were like to periſh for want of water. A further proofe of this point we haue in <hi>Ionah,</hi> who diſcourſing with his owne reaſon, thought it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but very dangerous for him to goe to preach at <hi>Niniue,</hi> and therefore refuſed to yeeld to the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord. But what wofull diſtreſſe did this diſobedience bring him into, when being in that ſore tempeſt, the ſea did roare, his conſcience accuſe him, men were againſt him, God was againſt him, and there was no way for him, but to be throwne into the ſea, and there to remaine three daies and three nights in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a whale?
<note place="margin">Iudges. 16.</note> The like may be ſeene in <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who being carried with boiſterous luſts, and immoderately and ſinfully affecting that vile ſtrumpet <hi>Dalilah,</hi> could hide nothing from her, but diſcouered vnto her very fooliſhly wherein his great ſtrength lay, namely in his haire: and ſo that being cut off, as a recompence of his folly and ſinfull dealing, he was betraied into the hands of his moſt deadly enemies the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> who puld out both his eyes, bound him in fetters, made him grinde in the priſon houſe, and beſides made him a laughing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150583:140"/>ſtocke vnto thoſe into whom he had formerly ſtricken a great terrour and amazement by his admirable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the ſtrange enterpriſes atchieued by him. Thus we may in part perceiue into what narrow ſtraits ſinne doth bring Gods owne children: but this is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially verified in wicked men, of whom it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Pſou. 22.5.</note> that <hi>thornes and ſnares are in the way of the froward:</hi> they are hedged in with thornes, and all their walke is vpon brakes: they run to hell with great vexation: they are intangled in ſnares continually, and are neuer out of them: they are caught in Sathans net, and held faſt by hardneſſe of heart, which neuer leaues them till either conuerſion, or vtter confuſion doe befall them.</p>
                  <p>But this will more fully appeare in particular ſinnes, as firſt to giue inſtance in drunkards, whoſe appetite doth prouoke them vnto that beaſtly abuſe of Gods good creatures: the wine delights their eye, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their taſte, and goeth downe merily:
<note place="margin">Pro. 23.32.29.30.</note> but <hi>in the end it will bite like a Serpent, and hurt like a cockatrice: for to whom is woe? to whom is ſorrow?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Euer to them that tarrie long at the wine, to them that goe and ſeeke mixt wine:</hi> for they ruinate and ouerthrow their eſtate, they ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and ſtaine their names, make their wiues to fall out with them, their children to contemne them, their companions to quarrell with them: their beſt friends to loath them: and after all this, they are a burden vnto themſelues, hauing their wittes crackt, and their bodies diſeaſed, and beeing fit for no place, but onely for hell.</p>
                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid of proud men: doth not their ſinne throwe them into great miſerie? Let vs conſider a little of <hi>Hamans</hi> fall, which was procured by his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie. God knewe what croſſe would moſt vexe his proud heart, and that he ſent him: for whereas all <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> honour could doe him no good, vnleſſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> would riſe vp before him, and doe him reuerence, that was a thorne vnto him, when hee could not make him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150583:141"/>doe it: but when hee muſt honour <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and be as a ſeruant vnto him, that was a ſnare vnto his ſoule, and therein was hee helde faſt, with horrible vexation and monſtrous ſhame, till death and damnation ſeazed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p>The like may bee ſeene in riotous and voluptuous perſons, who are whollie addicted to followe ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and gaming, and ſurfetting, and chambering, and wantonneſſe, with ſuch like ſinfull delights of the fleſh: the world thinks that ſuch liue a merrie life: but iudge not too well of them; they haue not paid all their ſhot as yet: they haue miſerie enough behinde, that ſtill purſues them, and at length will ouertake them: <hi>for hee that loues paſtime, ſhall be a poore man; and hee that loues wine and oyle ſhall not bee rich:</hi>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150583:141"/>it is added, that <hi>the deſire of mony is the roote of all euill:</hi> for it doth not onely poyſon mens hearts, make them erre from the faith, and bring them into the ſnares of the diuell, to be lead by him according to his will; but <hi>it pearſeth them thorow with many ſorrowes:</hi> for greedy wordlings are euer diſconted and froward, falling out with one, and chafing with another: ſo that thoſe things which ſeeme to glad their hearts, doe not indeed bring them any ſound contentment, becauſe their deſires can neuer be ſatisfied, but eſpecially becauſe they are often times much croſſed: as when their ſheepe or cattle miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, their grounds prooue vnfruitfull, their ſeruants vntruſty, theeues ſet vpon them by violence to ſpoile them of their goods, or ſubtill aduerſaries by craft ſeeke to defraud them of the ſame, with many ſuch like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, which will neither let them reſt quietly in the night, nor liue comfortably in the day: and the hearts of ſuch couetous perſons can tell them, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times all other things doe them no good, ſithence they cannot haue ſome one thing which they would, as the caſe ſtood with wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> in the matter of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boths</hi> vineyard.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer, earthly parents, when they ſet vpon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection with beſt ſtaiedneſſe, doe want knowledge and diſcretion, and therefore giue their children too little or too much:

                  <p>And becauſe the preſent occaſion requireth it, it will not be amiſſe to ſhew that the peſtilence, wherewith the Lord hath now viſited this Nation, is a fauourable and gentle correction, and that this ſword of the Lord is nothing ſo terrible as the ſword of man would be if he ſhould cauſe that to be drawne out againſt vs: and that for theſe reaſons:</p>

                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the time of the peſtilence the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion haue not ſuch matter of inſultation, as when warres are hote in the Land: for then they would triumph in this or the like manner: Now theſe forward men ſhall pay for it: downe they ſhall all the ſorte of them: they were wont to brag that God would be their buckler and their ſhield; their refuge, and their ſtrong tower of defence: but what will become of them now? thus would they inſult ouer Gods choſen, in the time of warre: but in the time of this ſicknes, they themſelues are exceedingly afraid, &amp; euen at their wits ende, (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hell and deſtruction gape for them, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer death taketh hold of them:) whereas Chriſtians are quiet, and full of peace &amp; ioy in the holy Ghoſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if they die, they ſhall go from earth to heauen, from a place of miſerie, to a palace of glorie.</p>

                  <p> Thirdly, this is a maruellous great mercie,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that there doth ſtill remaine the face of a Church, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is preached, the Sacraments adminiſtred, &amp; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth openly maintained: whereas if there were a forraine inuaſion, or a ciuill mutinie &amp; inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vſuall courſe of the minſterie, and of the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of religion, would be ſtopped, which now is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tollerated, but commanded.</p>

                  <p>Againe, in the times of warre,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> there is an vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of all meanes of maintenance and comfort: we cannot enioy our poſſeſſions, nor dwell in our houſes, nor reape the fruits of our labours, which now (through Gods mercie) is farre otherwiſe.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſo euen for our liues and for our ſoules, the caſe is better with vs in the time of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence then in the time of warres: for then all our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, wiues, children, ſeruants, and all may bee barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſlaine, or worſe vſed before our eyes, or we before theirs: and if not ſo, yet they muſt be left to Idolaters, and in danger to be vaſſalls of ſinne and Sathan: but now if death come, it is nothing ſo lamentable: if life bee graunted, it is nothing ſo dangerous: for though we be taken away, yet our friends ſhall remaine with the Saints &amp; ſeruants of God; and they that haue bene our Chriſtian frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, will be theirs, at leaſt there is very great hope of their happineſſe, both here, and hereafter, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that liberty of the Goſpell which through Gods goodnes is ſtill maintained. And therefore great cauſe haue wee to magnifie the name of God, that when our late gracious Queene was taken away, &amp; the Land muſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:150583:146"/>needs bee exerciſed with ſome heauie ſtroke or other, that hee then miraculouſlie deliuered vs from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſword of man, and ſmote our Nation with his owne ſword.</p>
                  <p>Now when this is ſaid to bee a fauourable ſtroke, we muſt vnderſtand that it is ſo only vnto Gods children, not to the wicked: concerning whoſe departure out of this world, it is ſaide, that <hi>Hell followeth death.</hi> If they bee not reconciled vnto God, but liue and die in their ſinnes,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 6.8.</note> their caſe is fearefull. And therefore is it a iuſt hand of God vpon impenitent ſinners, that they ſhould bee horriblie afraid of that ſicknes. No ſinne, nor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than himſelfe, is ſo much feared of them as the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nay nor Gods wrath it ſelfe: and therefore they care not what foule ſinne they commit, whereby they are ſure to incurre the Lords diſpleaſure, ſo their bodies may eſcape this plague of God.

                  <p>Albeit in regard of mans aſſiſtance, they be vtterly deſtitute, yet the Lord will be euer with them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtand for them. <hi>Dauids</hi> argument here is not this, Lord helpe: for there be many that will ioyne with thee: but this, Lord helpe, for there is none elſe that will helpe: ſo that our caſe is not according to mens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards vs, but according to Gods loue vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>This is euident in the prophecy of <hi>Micha,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micah. 7.2.</note> where it is ſhewed, that friends failed: neither did they faile one man alone, but the whole Church; <hi>good men were peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of the earth, and there was none righteous among men, &amp;c:</hi> but <hi>the beſt of them was a briar, and the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous of them ſharper than a throne hedge:</hi> yet the Church is not quite diſmaid, but reſolueth to fly vnto the Lord for ſuccour. <hi>Therefore will I looke vnto the Lord;
<note place="margin">Verſe. 7.</note> I will waite for God my Sauiour: my God will heare me,</hi> though
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150583:151"/>good men were dead and gone, and hypocrites did put on their ſhape and likeneſſe, that they might mere free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe miſchiefe.</p>
                  <p>Yet the people of God determine with themſelues not to caſt off all hope, but to relie vpon the Lord, and though he delay to helpe them for a time, yet they will waite vpon him, knowing that at length he will deale graciouſly with them.</p>
                  <p>And for the further confirmation of this point, we haue the example of Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, who being grieuouſly perplexed and troubled within and without, and on euery ſide, vſeth this argument vnto his father; <hi>Be not farre from me,

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> though all men doe forſake vs, yet Gods power is no whit diminiſhed thereby: and therefore that is a worthy ſpeech of faith in <hi>Ionathan,</hi> that it is not <hi>hard to the Lord to ſaue with many or with few:</hi> and in <hi>Aſa,</hi> who ſaith,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14.6. 2. Chro. 14.11</note> 
                     <hi>it is nothing to thee to helpe with many, or with no power.</hi> They knew that though they had few, or none at all on their ſide, they were in as good caſe as if they had many millions, if God were on their ſide: for all power is his, and that which men haue,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 62.11. Math. 6.</note> is but borrowed from him: and though he ſometimes vſe them, it is not becauſe he needs them: for who did helpe him in making of the heauens and of the earth, and of al the creatures in them both? and what aſſiſtance hath he now in ſuſtaining, and vpholding of the ſame? now if he neuer needed the aid of any creature in theſe greateſt workes of creation and preſeruation, ſurely he wanteth not the helpe of men in matters of ſmaller importance.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:150583:151"/>
                  <p> Secondly, Gods mercy is no more leſſened then his power is, by mens withdrawing of themſelues from vs,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he loues his people when they haue no friends, as well as when they haue many friends; nay he manifeſteth his loue more at ſuch times: for in him <hi>the fatherleſſe findeth mercy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.</note> And then doth he exerciſe the bowels of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men ſhew little or no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion at all.</p>
                  <p>When we ſee children to haue rich and mercifull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to prouide for them, we doe not much pitie them: but as for thoſe that are fatherleſſe and friendleſſe, that are hungry &amp; naked, and altogether deſtitute of reliefe, we tender their caſe, and are ready to releeue them. Can we carrie ſuch an affection towards other mens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are diſtreſſed and helpleſſe, and will not the Lord our God haue a greater care of his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the like caſe? Will he leaue them becauſe men haue forſaken them? No ſurely. But when they are in diſtreſſes and ſtraits, and that through their owne foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe and diſobedience, if they humble themſelues,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.</note> and cry vnto him, he will deliuer them, though men dare not, or will not ſpeake, or deale for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when Gods ſeruants are left deſtitute,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their faith is much exerciſed and increaſed: and then we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſpeed beſt, when we beleeue beſt. So long as we haue helpe about vs, we doe not ſo much ſet our faith a worke, as our carnall reaſon and ſenſe, and ſo pray not at all, or very coldly: but when we are deſolate and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and thoſe that ſhould be moſt for vs are againſt vs, then we begin to lift vp our hearts to heauen, and to caſt our ſelues vpon Gods prouidence and goodneſſe, and to vſe the weapons of the ſpirit, and not of the fleſh: this is plaine in <hi>Dauids</hi> example, who being in great danger in the caue, did at firſt looke about him, for helpe on this ſide, and on that: but ſeeing that all refuge failed him, what did he?

                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in ſuch times of difficultie, Gods glorious hand is more apparantly ſeene, and ſo all the honour is aſcribed vnto him. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Aegipt</hi> by force of armes, being aided with two or three millions of ſouldiers, much of the praiſe would haue bene giuen vnto them: but when <hi>Moſes</hi> was naked and altogether deſtitute of any power of man, the Lords mightie Arme was more cleerely ſeene in the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his people, and the ſubuerſion of their enemies. And that worke of his, hath bene, is, and ſhall be memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in all ages.</p>
                  <p>So alſo, if <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> ſickneſſe had beene ſuch as anie Phyſitian could haue cured, his recouerie ſhould neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ife was as much as the giuing of a ſecond life, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it was taken and giuen by the holie Ghoſt, to the euerlaſting honour of Gods name. And as it was then, ſo is it yet ſtill, and euer ſhall be to the end of the world: the greater the extremities and neceſſities of the Saints bee, wherein God doeth relieue them, and out of which hee doth deliuer them, the more will it be for the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of his omnipotencie, and of his tender mercie therein expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>This ſerueth,</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> Firſt, for the confutation of their fooliſh conceit and expectation, who ſeeing mighty aduerſaries againſt the Church, and fewe or no friends to interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, preſently conclude, that their caſe is deſperate: downethey muſt: they are vtterly vndone: and ſo they begin to forecaſt in their mindes the manner of their ouerthrow, &amp; the forme of their lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation, when they ſhall bee thus and thus handled. But theſe men, for all their deepe reach, may bee deceiued; for all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions are grounded on men: they doe not conſider
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150583:152"/>what God may doe, as wee ſee in <hi>Dauids</hi> enemies, who perceiuing that manie did band themſelues together, and riſe vp againſt him; concluded,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 3.1.2.3.</note> that <hi>there was no helpe for him in God.</hi> But what ſayes <hi>Dauid? Lorde, thou art a buckler for mee, my glorie, and the lifter vp of my head.</hi> And in another Pſalme,

No, hee is farre from that; hee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther layeth faſter hold on God,

                  </p>
                  <p>From this lamentable complaint of his, ariſeth this doctrine, that</p>
                  <p>No outward thing comes neerer the hearts of God children,
<label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">want of good men much to be lamented.</note> then the decay of good men.</p>
                  <p>It much troubleth the ſoules of godly men, to ſee a ſmall number of Chriſtians. Hence proceedeth that lamentation of the Prophet <hi>Micah: Woe is me, for I am as the Summer gatherings,
<note place="margin">Micah. 7.1.2.</note> &amp;c:</hi> or, I am in caſe, as in the deſtruction of the Summer fruites: as in <hi>Hoſeah</hi> it is ſaid,

                     <hi>The fiſhes of the Sea ſhall be gathered:</hi> that is, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and that this is the ſenſe, it appeareth in the words following, when it is ſaid, <hi>There is no cluſter to eate: My ſoule deſired the firſt ripe fruites:</hi> that is, I am as one that hath a feruent longing for them, and yet can get none of them; and what is the reaſon of this his lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>The good man</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is periſhed out of the earth, and there is none righteous among men, &amp;c.</hi> So that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of thoſe words is thus much: that looke how world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings would grieue, if they ſhould ſee their grapes and figges (which were ſpeciall commodities in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys) to faile, and their expectation that way to bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fruſtrate; ſo, and much more bitterly did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet bewaile the loſſe of good &amp; righteous men. That was it alſo that did ſo pierce the heart of <hi>Elias. Lorde</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the children of Iſrael haue forſaken thy couenant, broken down thy Altars,
<note place="margin">1.

                     <note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> In which regard whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord would comfort him, he vſeth a fit
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150583:153"/>remedie for his diſeaſe: for whereas his griefe was that there were no godly men left, but all were declined to <hi>Idolatrie,</hi>

                  <p>Yet further it may appeare what a matter of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the loſſe of good men is vnto thoſe that are good themſelues, by that ſpeech of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>All my delight is in the Saints:</hi> for if they be his chiefe delight,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> then the want of them muſt needs be an occaſion of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great anguiſh vnto him: as is euident that it was. <hi>Pſalm.</hi>

                  <p>Now the reaſons why the decay of Gods people is and ſhould be ſuch an heart-breaking vnto the reſt of the Saints, are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe the glory of God is precious vnto them,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> which is much hindered and obſerued when his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants are diminiſhed: for then there is leſſe ſeruice done vnto him in publike and priuate: there are fewer prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praiſes offered vp vnto him, fewer religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes in vſe amongſt men, and fewer workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy performed vnto the needie and diſtreſſed. And if the decay of good ſouldiers and of loyall ſubiects in any
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150583:154"/>kingdome muſt needs be a matter of griefe to thoſe that loue and ſeeke the honour of their King; then can it not but goe neere the hearts of the godly, when they perceiue the ſouldiers and ſubiects of Chriſt to goe to wracke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in regard of themſelues they are mooued heereat, as being fellow members with them: for when the godly periſh, they are as it were a maimed body. They haue fewer friends and fellow-helpers, fewer to pray with them and for them, fewer to reprooue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, and comfort them, and in a word, fewer to whom they may doe good, and from whom they may receiue good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in reſpect of the publike loſſe, they mourne for the decay of the righteous: for when multitudes of all nations, and of all ſorts of people, doe know the waies of God, and praiſe the name of God, then (as the Prophet ſaith) <hi>the earth ſhall bring foorth her increaſe,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 67.5.</note> and God euen our God ſhall bleſſe vs.</hi> If there be but ten righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men and women in a Citie, or ſome few in a whole Country, all the reſt ſhall ſpeed the better for their ſakes: how much more then if there be multitudes of them? What a griefe therefore muſt it needs be to the wiſe and godly, when theſe props and pillars of the Church and Common-wealth are taken away?</p>
                  <p>Which ſerueth,</p>
                  <p>Firſt,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> for the iuſt reproofe of thoſe that doe carrie a deadly enmitie againſt the multitude of Chriſtians that now are, and doe much grieue that there ſhould be ſo many that reſort vnto the word in publike, that read it in priuate, that haue praier and ſinging of Pſalmes in their families, &amp;c. they grudge and murmur at it, as if ſome conſpiracie or mutinie againſt the State were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and as if the good of mens ſoules, and the peace of the common-wealth could not ſtand together. Theſe are of another ſpirit then <hi>Dauid</hi> was, who lamented
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:150583:154"/>that there were ſo few ſuch: and theſe are indeed vtter enemies vnto God, who eſteemes his people to be his chiefe treaſure vnder heauen: and therefore they ſhall beare their iudgement, whoſoeuer they be that doe thus malice the ſeruants of God, and endeuour to peruert them, or to diminiſh the number of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>2</label> heere is matter of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are of the ſame diſpoſition that <hi>Dauid</hi> was, that crynight and day, <hi>Helpe Lord, for the godly periſh,</hi> &amp;c: &amp; that labour with God, by faſting, and weeping, &amp; praying, that he would vphold the ſtate of his Church. If the praier of <hi>Dauid,</hi> being but one man, were effectuall for the continuing of Gods people, how much more forcible ſhall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of many thouſands be, who doe vnceſſantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the Lord with great earneſtneſſe to <hi>be fauourable vnto Sion,</hi> and to <hi>build vp the walles of Ieruſalem,</hi> to ſaue his choſen, and defend his owne heritage againſt the malicious plots and practiſes of all their enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They ſpeake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour.]</hi>

Now in that his chiefe complaint is againſt them, the doctrine is, that</p>
                  <p>Deceitfull friends are worſe then open and apparant foes.
<label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">Fained friends worſe then open foes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> had diuers profeſſed enemies, as <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſuch as were neere him: yet none of their practiſes went ſo neere his heart, as theſe mens that would pretend to be friendly vnto him.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe it is ſaid by <hi>Salomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 27.6.</note> that <hi>The wounds of a louer are faithfull, and the kiſſes of an enemie are to be praied againſt:</hi> (for ſo the words muſt be read) When a faithfull friend doth rebuke vs, and ſeeke to wound our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150583:155"/>hearts for ſinne, that is exceeding profitable for vs: but when an enemie vnder pretence of loue (whereof by kiſſing they then made ſhew) doth come againſt vs,
<note place="margin">Indas, Matth. 26.49.</note> and ſeeke to vndermine vs, that is exceeding dangerous, and the hurt thereof much to be praied againſt.</p>
                  <p>The waters that runne ſmoothly and mildly are commonly moſt deepe and dangerous, whereas that which roares is more ſhallow and ſafe.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons of this doctrine are,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, that ſuch craftie foxes doe more eaſily come within a man, and ſooner deceiue him. An open enemie commeth as it were before ones face, and ſo his blowes may be better warded off: but a falſe friend commeth behind ones backe, and faſteneth a deadly blow ere a man be aware: and therefore <hi>Ioab,</hi> when he would ſpeed <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> did not bid open defiance vnto them, but (being therein more crafty and ſubtill, then either godly or manly) gaue them kind ſalutations, and, vnder pretence of loue, moſt cruelly murdered them both. And as it is for the outward man, ſo is it alſo for the ſoule. The moſt dangerous temptations are thoſe that proceed from fained friends vnder the colour of loue, and deſire of our good. If Sathan had come vnto <hi>Eue,</hi> and told her, I charge you eat of the tree in the midſt of the garden, &amp; whatſoeuer the danger be, ſtand not vpon that, for I will haue your husband and you to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſhe would neuer haue hearkened vnto him: but when he perſwaded her, that he was her friend, and meant her good, namely, that by eating thereof ſhe might be made like vnto God himſelfe, knowing both good and euill, then was ſhe ouertaken by him, and ſo being ouercome herſelfe, ſhe became the inſtrument of the diuell, to deceiue her husband in like ſort. And ſo it is with many, that haue held out well againſt raging and violent temptations, and yet haue beene foulely drawne aſide, and ſhamefully foiled by milder tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150583:155"/>vnto profit, or pleaſure, or credit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the falſe dealing of ſuch counterfeit friends,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth much more afflict the heart of a man, then any iniurious actions of manifeſt aduerſaries: as we may ſee in that Pſalme of <hi>Dauid,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Surely mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie did not defame me, for I could haue borne it,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>but it was thou, ô man, euen my companion, my guide, and my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,</hi> &amp;c. When his words were ſmooth, and ſofter then butter, and yet prooued deceitfull, they went thorow his heart euen as ſwords: and this was iuſt vpon him, becauſe he had dealt in that ſort with his faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect <hi>Vriah,</hi> ſeeming to fauour him by imploying him in ſpeciall ſeruices, when he went about to take away his life, that he might couer his owne iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore let this inſtruct vs to take another courſe: if we haue inward diſlike, let vs profeſſe it:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> if we carry a louing affection, let vs make ſhew of it, and loue not in word alone, but in deed, as the Apoſtle exhorteth.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially let vs looke vnto this in matters betwixt God and vs: let vs not play the hypocrites with him, pretending a loue vnto the Church of God, and to the word of God, when there is no ſuch matter; and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere vnto him with our lips, when our hearts are farre from him: for in ſo doing we ſhall offer great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury vnto the Lord, and doe more hurt at length then thoſe that are profeſt Papiſts or Atheiſts: for ſuch as flatter with their lips, and diſſemble with a double heart in things that concerne the holy religion of God, if any perſecution come, will quite renounce their profeſſion, and betray the cauſe of God, and grieue the ſeruants of God, and harden the hearts, and open the blaſphemous mouthes of the enemies of God, and make many to fall by their reuolting and backſliding. Therefore let euery one that taketh vpon him the profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, be a true, &amp; not a fained friend of the ſame; and bring a faithfull, and not a guilefull heart thereunto;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150583:156"/>that the Lord may witneſſe for him, that he doth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and vnfainedly ſeeke him.</p>

                  <p>Now in that the Prophet prayeth againſt ſuch as doe ſo cunningly carry their matters, that they will appeare to loue, where they hate with a deadly hatred, and in praying doth ſhew, not only what is his wiſh, but what is Gods purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord will <hi>cut off the flattering lips:</hi> hence this doctrine may be gathered, that,</p>
                  <p>The more skilfully and artificially anie contriues his euill purpoſes,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> the more fearefull deſtruction ſhall fall vpon him.
<note place="margin">The more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any is for miſchiefe, the more fearefull ſhall his ruine be.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more fraudulent a deceiuer anie one is, the more heauy ſhall the hand of God be vpon him, to croſſe and contrarie him, and to bring him to ſuch ſtraits, that hee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:150583:157"/>ſhall not for ſhame open his mouth againe to ſpeake as he hath done: and this is to haue his tongue cut out, as it were, as is threatned in this place.</p>
                  <p>Flatterers haue a certaine kinde of dexterity in their enterpriſes, that they will not be ſeene to be brochers of thoſe things whereof they afterwards become practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: but they ſpeed neuer the better, but a great deale the worſe for that. Therefore doth <hi>Dauid</hi> conclude,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 52.4.5.</note> that God would certainely deſtroy <hi>Doeg,</hi> becauſe hee was a skilfull worke-man, and as it were a tradeſman in miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: he could flatter <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he wiſheth him well, and was ſorry for his troubles, and would be ready to be friend him in any thing he could: but when <hi>Saul</hi> complaines how hardly he was dealt with, in that no body would diſcouer vnto him the treacheries of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Deog</hi> changeth his tune, and falleth to accuſe <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 22.8.9. &amp;c.</note> and moſt iniuriouſly chargeth <hi>Abimelech</hi> to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with him: and for all this, he (no doubt) would haue goodly pretences: as, that dutie bound him to ſpeake as he did: he reſpected the Kings honour and ſafety, and certainely things were not well, but ſome miſchiefe was a working; for he ſaw the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai</hi> come vnto <hi>Abimelech</hi> who gaue him a ſword, and asked counſell of the Lord for him, and miniſtred food vnto him, and to thoſe that were with him, and that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary food too, euen the ſhew-bread: in which regard, he, as a loyall ſubiect, muſt needs aduertiſe <hi>Saul</hi> to take heed, and to looke well to himſelfe, that ſo he might preuent all imminent dangers.</p>
                  <p>So in the prophecie of <hi>Ieremie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 4.22.</note> this is ſet downe as one cauſe of the vtter ſubuerſion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that <hi>they were wiſe to doe euill,</hi> but <hi>had no knowledge to doe well.</hi> They wanted not ordinarie capacitie, (which had beene one degree of happineſſe vnto them, for then God would haue ſhewed them greater compaſſion) but they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grace to vſe it well, and had cunning heads to plot
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150583:158"/>miſchiefe, and therefore doth the Lord threaten iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them. And in another place he ſaith, that <hi>they had taught their tongues to ſpeake lies.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 9.5.</note> And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth? <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Behold, I will melt them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shall not I viſit them for this, ſaith the Lord? Or ſhall not my ſoule be auenged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> Their tongues were too much inclined to lies of their owne accord, ſo that they needed not to be taught that language: yet did they ſet their tongues to ſchoole, as it were, that they might be artificiall in their leaud practiſes, &amp; carry out their lies vnder a colour of truth, and ſo ſinne with leſſe diſgrace: which was a thing that the Lord could not abide, and therefore he threatneth to plague them therefore.</p>
                  <p>And good reaſon is there that it ſhould be ſo:
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſons. </seg>1</label> for</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſuch perſons are extreamely hurtfull. Neuer is euill practiſed with ſuch miſchiefe, as when it is contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by craft, and poliſhed with deceit. The Apoſtles were neuer ſo troubled in dealing either with the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or with the ſuperſtitious and malicious <hi>Iewes,</hi> as they were when they had to doe with thoſe that pretended to be Chriſtians, to be Miniſters of the Goſpell, yea to be Apoſtles: and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulateth the matter with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>O fooliſh Galathians,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> who hath bewitched you?</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, No man could deale ſo dangerouſly as theſe falſe Teachers, who haue as it were charmed your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and bewitched your mindes. And in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he greatly complaineth of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers:
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>I am iealous ouer you with a godly iealouſie: for I haue prepared you for one husband, to preſent you as a pure Virgin to Chriſt. But I feare leſt as the Serpent beguiled Eue through his ſubtiltie, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Verſ. 13.14.15.</note> For ſuch falſe Apostles are deceitfull workers, and transforme themſelues into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt. And no maruell, for Sathan himſelfe is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150583:158"/>into an Angell of light. Therefore it is no great thing though his Ministers transforme themſelues, as though they were the Miniſters of righteouſnes. Paul</hi> had taken great paines to make a match betwixt Chriſt and them, and to fit them for ſuch a glorious husband: but he was much afraide leſt it would be broken, in regard of manie of them, and that as the Diuell deceiued <hi>Eue,</hi> ſo the falſe Apoſtles would deceiue them, and that by transforming themſelues into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, making ſhew (as the Diuell doth,) of the greateſt loue and care of their good, and of their eternall ſaluation: when the truth was, they intended no ſuch thing, but onely the ſeruing of themſelues, in their carnall credit and commoditie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> albeit ſuch kinde of perſons doe worke much miſchiefe, yet they ſeldome paſſe vnder the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of men for the ſame, and therefore it ſtands the Lord vpon to rebuke and puniſh them; Nay, they are ſo farre from being condemned by men, that they haue great thankes many times, for their wiſe counſell and good aduice (though it be moſt vile and diuelliſh,) in incenſing mens mindes againſt ſuch as haue wronged them, and putting it into their heads how they may bee auenged of them; which is a thing moſt deteſtable before God, and therefore ſhall not goe vnpuniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their hearts are maruellouſly hardened:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for when they can fetch ouer men according as they liſt, they intertaine an opinion of ſingular witte and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, &amp; of a deepe reach in themſelues, and ſo begin to contemne others, and will not admit of a reproofe or admonition from any: and therefore being growen to this height of pride, and this exceeding hardneſſe of heart, they are the more fit for Gods iudgements to be executed vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Gods wiſedome is much magnified by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt ſuch: they are fit aduerſaries for him, <hi>who ſcattereth the deuices of the craftie,
<note place="margin">Iob. 5.12.</note> ſo that their handes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150583:159"/>cannot accompliſh that which they enterpriſe,</hi> (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) and <hi>that taketh the crafty in their craftineſſe,</hi> cauſing thoſe that are cunning hunters and fowlers, to <hi>fall into the pit that they haue digged for others,</hi> and to be <hi>inſnared in the works of their owne handes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 7. &amp; 9.</note> ſo that when they goe about to take others, it falleth out by the righteous and wiſe prouidence of God, that they are taken themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Sith it is ſo dangerous to haue a crafty and cunning head,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> cloſely to plot and contriue miſchiefe, let this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh vs to beware of that vice: for aſſuredly, it will bring ſhame vpon the fauourers thereof. The wiſe man ſaith,
<note place="margin">Prou. 24.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee that imagineth to doe euill, men ſhall call him an authour of wickedneſſe.</hi> All men ſhall point at ſuch a one, There goeth a crafty fellow, a ſubtill Foxe, &amp;c: ſo that the name of a vagrant is not more odious then his: euery one hath ſuch in deteſtation, euen the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible of the people: Doe you ſee yonder man?

And as it is a blemiſh to the name, ſo it is the bane of ones eſtate to bee a fraudulent dealer. <hi>The bread of deceit</hi> (ſaith Salomon) <hi>is ſweete to a man,
<note place="margin">Prou 20.17.</note> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward his mouth ſhall be filled with grauell.</hi> Howſoeuer deceitfull perſons doe ſnatch heere and there, and get much from others, yet few of them thriue, but the curſe of God lighting vpon that which they haue, makes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke of all. And therefore as wee tender our eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and good eſtate in the world, let vs beware of ſuch practiſes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> let vs hence learne, not to be diſcouraged at crafty aduerſaries, that haue winding wits, &amp; plotting heads, and flattering tongues, and acceptance with great ones, euen as they would wiſh: let vs not bee diſmayed heereat, but let this be our comfort, when they fawne,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:150583:159"/>and flatter, and lie, and traduce vs moſt ſhamefully, that <hi>the Lord will cut off the lying lips.</hi> Grant that we haue not libertie or skill to encounter them, yet the Lord hath: <hi>There is no wiſedome, nor vnderſtanding,

<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.10.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord breaketh the counſell of the Heathen, and bringeth to nought the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people.</hi> Though all the wiſedome of all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the earth were laide together, yet God would bring all their conſultations to nothing if they made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. When <hi>Achitophel</hi> fell from <hi>Dauid</hi> to take part with <hi>Abſolon,</hi> it much troubled <hi>Dauid,</hi> for his words were as Oracles, and none could ſpeake more in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of policie then he, and he knew all <hi>Dauids</hi> heart, and the ſtate of the whole kingdome, and therefore he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelfe vnto God: <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I pray thee turne the counſell of Achitophel into fooliſhneſſe:</hi> and God heard his requeſt, and did ſo, inſomuch that no creature could deale more fooliſhly for the procuring of his owne euerlaſting woe and ſhame, then he did in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The diuell is ſtill labouring to worke miſchiefe, and he wants not craft nor ſubtiltie, beſides the experience that he hath had from the beginning of the world hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therunto: yet for all this, he hath neuer beene, nor ſhall be able to procure the ouerthrow of one of Gods elect. The Church hath beene nothing the worſe, though he haue beene ſtill warring againſt it. And why is this, but becauſe Gods wiſedome is infinitly beyond all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the diuell? And what cauſe haue we then to feare craſty men, ſeeing their Captaine hath had no better ſucceſſe, and ſeeing that the Lord hath a quarrell againſt them as well as againſt their head?</p>

                  <p>So when <hi>Saneherib</hi> inſulted againſt God,

<label type="milestone">

                  <p>Firſt, when vngodly men do moſt vaunt of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious intents againſt Gods people, then is the Lords compaſſion moſt ſtirred towards them: euen as it is with earthly parents, when any one threatens their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that if hee take them, hee will knocke out their braines; this will cauſe them to preuide for the ſafetie of their children, and that ſuch leaud perſons bee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and reſtrained.</p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Dauids</hi> comfort againſt <hi>Doeg:

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150583:160"/>
                     <hi>The louing kindneſſe of God endureth daily.</hi> If the ſtocke of Gods goodnes were all ſpent, then his children had reaſon to hang downe their heads: but ſeeing that is, and will be as much ſtill as euer it was, they neede not feare the inſultations of their wicked aduerſaries.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> at ſuch times Gods ſeruants begin to looke about them: when their enemies ſpeake of wonders that they will worke againſt them, then they are wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſtirred vp to crie vnto the Lord, as in the 94.

                  <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſuch proud perſons doe bid defiance to the Lord himſelfe, and therefore hee hath a quarrell againſt them. <hi>All the proud [in heart] are an abomination vnto him.</hi> But if their pride appeare in a more notorious manner in their tongues, and in their behauiour, they are much more hatefull vnto him:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.</note> for in making boaſt of their owne hearts deſire, they doe contemne the Lord; and in ſpeaking againſt the Church,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.9.</note> they ſet their tongues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heauen it ſelfe, as the Prophet ſpeaketh.</p>
                  <p>Which point thus prooued, miniſtreth vnto vs,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God hath giuen Lawes for the tongue,

                  <p>Thirdly,

                  <p> For this vertue, amongſt many others, are the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Corinthians</hi> commended:
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold this, that yee haue beene godly ſorrowfull,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) what zeale it hath wrought in you!</hi> &amp;c. Till ſuch time as the Apoſtle had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them by an Epiſtle, they were either not at all, or very ſlightly touched with the ſenſe of their owne ſins, and therefore they ſet light by the offences of others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that when abominable inceſt (ſuch as had not beene heard of amongſt the Gentiles) was committed among them, yet they tooke it not to heart, nor at all mourned for it,
<note place="margin">1.

This was the effect of holy griefe in them, and this will be found in all that attaine to that repentance which is vnto life: in which regard, when the Lord would worke a cure vpon the luke-warme <hi>Laodicians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reu. 3.19.</note> he biddeth them, <hi>be zealous, and amend.</hi> That was their ſinne, that they were key-cold, and euen fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in the dregges of ſecuritie, exerciſing themſelues in ſundrie good duties (for that muſt needes be, becauſe they were a Church) but neuer regarding with what loue vnto God or men they performed the ſame: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord vrging them to reformation, willeth them <hi>[to be zealous, and amend]</hi> implying, that theſe two
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:150583:163"/>euer goe hand in hand, to wit, ſound repentance, and godly zeale: yet ſo, that as euery one is of greater growth in the body of Chriſt, ſo this grace is of greater ſtrength in him: as is euident in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſpeaketh thus of himſelfe (and that by the inſpiration of Gods holy ſpirit,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.139.</note> and therefore cannot but ſpeake truely) <hi>My zeale hath euen conſumed me, becauſe mine enemies haue forgotten thy word.</hi> Weaker Chriſtians haue ſome good motions of griefe for mens offances: but the Prophet was exceedingly wrought vpon by his zeale, ſo that it did euen ſpend him, and conſume him, in regard of the fearefull breach of Gods commandements, which he obſerued in his very enemies.

                  <p>But moſt admirable was the zeale of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Rules of true zeale,</note> therefore touching the matter about which this holy zeale is to be exerciſed, it muſt be good:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of the Apoſtle: <hi>It is good alwaies to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:150583:164"/>be zealous in [a good matter:]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The matter muſt be good, Gal. 4.18.</note> and it was before ſhewed, that Gods people muſt be zealous <hi>of [good workes:]</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, if the matter be euill, the more earneſt any is, the more ſinfull: neither is ſuch earneſtneſſe worthy the name of zeale, being nothing elſe but a diuelliſh and fleſhly heate, or rather a kinde of frenzie and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Such was the zeale of I dolaters that would man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and cut themſelues, and that would offer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the fire in honour vnto their gods. Such was the zeale of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. King. 18.28 Ier. 7.31.</note> who would <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe ſea and land to make one a Proſelite:</hi> that is, one of their owne ſect.</p>
                  <p>With this violent and mad zeale was <hi>Paul</hi> carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his conuerſion (as he himſelfe confeſſeth in plaine tearmes, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26.11. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6.) when he was enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt Chriſtians, and ſpared no paines nor coſt to make them denie and blaſpheme the name of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Heere then is to be condemned the zeale of ignorant Papiſts and Browniſts, and ſuch like, who are very hotte indeed (for he muſt needes runne whom the diuell driues) but in euill cauſes, as might eaſily be prooued, and may hence, if by no other arguments, be probably concluded, in that they vſe the diuels owne weapons (to wit, lying, ſlandering, railing, curſed ſpeaking, and the like) in the purſute of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But much more damnable and vile is their zeale to be eſteemed, who againſt their knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, doe violently and maliciouſly oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the Goſpell, and the profeſſors thereof, and ſtand for falſhood and wickedneſſe, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers thereof: as did thoſe wretched Phariſes that ſet themſelues againſt our Sauiour, and committed the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt.
<note place="margin">We muſt know the thing to be good for vvhich vve are zealous.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond rule is, that as the matter in which we are zealous, muſt be good in it ſelfe, ſo it muſt be knowne vnto vs to be of that qualitie. True zeale muſt begin
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:150583:164"/>where the word begins, and ende where it ends:
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it cannot bee of faith, which is euer grounded on theword; and whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne. We muſt not therefore content our ſelues with an honeſt meaning, and hope that wee haue a good zeale towards God, when we haue no warrant for our hope: but muſt ſo acquaint our ſelues with the Scriptures of God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 10.2.</note> that our zeale may be according to knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Which rule diſcouereth the corruptnes of their zeale, whether cloſe hypocrites, or weake Chriſtians, who are led on meerely by the examples of good men, whome they affect, much to like of, and earneſtly to ſtand for ſuch things, as they perceiue them in their practiſe to obſerue, and to make conſcience of: and if there be but a word ſpoken againſt any of the things that they haue taken a liking of, they are maruellouſly ſtirred with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation thereat, and grow paſſionate and vehement againſt the parties, though they haue neuer ſo good a meaning in that which they ſpeake: Yet let them bee vrged to prooue out of the word the neceſſitie of thoſe duties which they ſo earneſtly preſſe, they can ſay little or nothing to the purpoſe for them; and ſo grow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times either to diſlike and forſake all if they bee hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, or at leaſt to bee diſcouraged, and to bee at a ſtand, if they be weaklings in Chriſt Ieſus. And whence proceed theſe inconueniences but from this, that they are zealous for things that in themſelues, and vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are good and holie, but not thoroughly diſcerned of them to bee of that nature: the conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſhould make vs to ſit ſure in matters of godlineſſe, not building vpon the example of good men, but vpon the truth of the good word of God, and then our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſhall neuer faile vs.</p>
                  <p>A third propertie of true zeale is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that it beginneth in our ſelues, and after proceedeth vnto others:
<note place="margin">Zeale muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at home.</note> for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can that man be truely zealous to others, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:150583:165"/>knew to be zealous to himſelfe. Thoſe are the moſt skilfull Phyſitions and beſt able to deale with others, that haue firſt wrought a cure vpon their owne ſoules. Therefore our Sauiours aduice is,
<note place="margin">Luke. 6.42.</note> 
                     <hi>Caſt out the beame out of thine owne eye firſt, and then ſhalt thou ſee perfectly to pull out the meate that is in thy brothers eye.</hi> We muſt then firſt of all iudge our ſelues, and caſt the firſt ſtone at our ſelues, that ſo finding how vgly and noiſome a thing ſinne is, and that by experience in our ſelues, we may be at defiance with it, whereſoeuer we finde it, and neither fiatter others in their euill courſes, nor yet too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and vnmercifully rebuke them for the ſame. Thoſe that haue beene pinched with ſickneſſe and are recouered, can by the ſmart which they haue felt, pittie others in the like caſe: euen ſo they which haue beene ſtung with ſinne themſelues, can more eaſily be moued to ſhew compaſſion towards poore ſinners like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, becauſe by the feeling of miſery, men learne the practiſe of mercy,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.17.18.</note> in that Chriſt ſuffered and was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he is able to pittie and to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this rule doe all hypocrites offend, who will wade very deepely into other mens ſoules, and very bloodily gore other mens conſciences, who yet neuer once purged their owne vncleane ſincks at home, nor drew one drop of blood out of their owne corrupt hearts. Such were the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> who pleaſed themſelues much in iudging and cenſuring our Sauiour and his Diſciples;
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.15. &amp; 18.9.</note> but were ſo farre from condemning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as faultie in any thing, that they inſtified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before God and men. Such alſo are the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> which are readie to burſt their bowels with crying out againſt diſorders abroad, and yet neuer reforme their owne ſoules at home: for if they did, they would alſo reforme their liues and their families. But what kind of zeale theſe mens is, wofull and late experience ſtill cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150583:165"/>in our eares: for manie of them being ſo zealous to others, but onely through ſome ſecret loue of the world, when they had that which they ſought for, made knowne their hollow &amp; their rotten zeale, in that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out griefe of conſcience, they could ſuddenly ruſh into a profound worldlineſſe: and without all godly ſorrow, could (after they had ſatisfied their greedie and fleſhly zeale) not onely more hardlie ſeare vp their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but alſo be ſo changed, that they could ſowe vp their lippes, and ſpare their words from ſpeaking in like manner againe to others, and ſo are neither zealous to themſelues nor others.</p>
                  <p>Heere alſo are all ſuch to be cenſured as faultie, that can prie and make a priuie ſearch into the wants of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, accounting the ſame wants no wants in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The father ſaith, this my childe doth amiſſe: and the childe, in this my father faileth: the husband knoweth, what the wife ſhould doe; and the wife, what the husband ſhould doe, &amp;c: euery one in the meane time neglecting their owne duties; whereas indeed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones principall care ſhould bee, to know and doe his owne dutie, and to be grieued where he commeth ſhort of the ſame. And thus much for the third rule, that true zeale muſt beginne in our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Now further we are to vnderſtand,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that there muſt be an order kept in being thus zealous: namely,
<note place="margin">Wee muſt make greateſt account of the vveightieſt matters. Matth. 23.23.</note> that firſt and eſpeciallie wee make conſcience of the principall matters of the word, and after of the leſſer, as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our telleth the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes: Theſe things ought yee to haue done,</hi> (that is, the weightier matters of the Law) <hi>and not to haue left the other vndone:</hi> viz. matters of ſmaller importance.</p>
                  <p>Which ſheweth, that their zeale is verie corrupt and faulty, who as our Sauior ſaith, <hi>ſtraine out a Gnat, &amp; ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Camell;</hi> who are very hot about matters of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, but altogether cold in matters of ſubſtance: as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150583:166"/>alſo theirs that (on the other ſide) will crie out againſt them that rob by the high-wayes ſide, &amp; yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues make no conſcience of pilfring, &amp; coſoning, and ſecret defrauding of their neighbours: as if ſmall ſinnes were not to be left as well as great.</p>
                  <p>Another rule of true zeale is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that wee looke as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to our hearts before God,
<note place="margin">We muſt look to the inſide, as vvell as to the out-ſide. Ier. 4.14. Iam. 4.8.</note> as to our carriage before men: for ſo the Lord commandeth, <hi>Cleanſe thy heart, ô Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>how long ſhall thy euill thoughts remaine within thee?</hi> And againe, <hi>Purge your hands, yee ſinners, and [your hearts] yee hypocrites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which ſerueth to ouerthrow the hypocriſie of ſuch <hi>Phariſes, as make cleane the vtter ſide of the cuppe and plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> but within are full of bribery and exceſſe,</hi> of pride, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, ſelfe-loue, and hatred.</p>
                  <p>Now that wee may the better trie our ſelues by this rule, two things are to be obſerued,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That wee feare to commit any ſinne ſecretly, and when wee are alone, as well as when wee are in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of men.
<note place="margin">Iob. 31. Gen. 39.</note> So did <hi>Iob,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> and this mooued them ſo to doe, euen that the Lord did behold them, and could puniſh them for ſecret, as well as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen offences.</p>
                  <p>Which condemneth them of groſſe diſſimulation, that are loth to be accounted ill, and yet make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be ill. What is this, but to be painted ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that are faire to looke vpon, but within <hi>full of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bones?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> Wee may deceiue men, but God is not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and therefore let vs beware of this hypocriſie: and ſo much the rather, becauſe the Lorde hath fearefully diſcouered and plagued them, that in outward ſhew haue borne a great conuntenance of religion, and yet haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſecret filthineſſe, and other vile ſinnes, which in time haue come to light to their ſhame and ruine.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is, that wee haue an eye to the priuie corruptions that lurke in our hearts,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150583:166"/>and maintaine continuall warre againſt them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and this we ſhould the rather doe, becauſe it is a fearefull, and yet an vſuall iudgement of God, and that vpon many profeſſors, that making no conſcience of entertaining wretched luſts and vile affections ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, they haue broken foorth to the committing of the groſſe actions, and ſo haue ſhamed themſelues pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. And this is a iuſt ſtroke vpon thoſe that would rather ſeeme to be, then in truth deſire to be godly, that making no conſcience of their thoughts and inward deſires, they ſhould in time be ſo giuen vp, as to make no conſcience of their words or deeds.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth rule is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that wee be more ſtrict vnto our ſelues then vnto others,
<note place="margin">Wee muſt be more ſtrict to our ſelues then to others.</note> and more ſeuere againſt our ſelues, then againſt others, giuing more libertie vnto them, then wee will take vnto our ſelues. And firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſeueritie vnto our ſelues, ſuch ought to bee our acquaintance with our inward and outward corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo grieuous ought they to be in our eyes, that our heate being ſpent vpon our ſelues, wee may thinke the ſinnes of others more tollerable, and ſo learne by the ſight and ſenſe of our owne ſores,
<note place="margin">Titus. 3.1.</note> to deale more mildely and meekely with others, whoſe corruptions (either for greatnes or multitude) we cannot ſo thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee as wee may our owne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as we muſt deale moſt ſharpely againſt our ſelues, ſo muſt we be ready to giue more outward liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto others then to our ſelues. And for this we haue the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was ſo ſtrict to himſelfe, that he would not take of the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> ſo much as a threed or latchet, and yet he would not denie <hi>Aner,
<note place="margin">Gen. 14.23.24.</note> Eſcol,</hi> and <hi>Mamre,</hi> their liberty. So <hi>Iob,</hi> as he would not permit to himſelfe, ſo neither would he deny to his permit to himſelfe, ſo neither would he deny to his children their liberty of feaſting. But eſpecially the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Paul</hi> is notable for the confirmation of this point: for ſeeing that in ſome places he could not ſo
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150583:167"/>conueniently liue of other mens charges,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.12. 1. Theſſ. 2.9.</note> as at <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> he would labour with his owne hands, rather then be chargeable to any of them: yet he would not that all men ſhould be tied by his example to doe the like:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 1. Tim. 5.18.</note> and therefore he laboureth much in his Epiſtles about this, that Miniſters ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for: ſo ſtrict was he to himſelfe; ſuch liberty left he vnto others.</p>
                  <p>Whence we may eaſily perceiue, that it is rather a Phariſaicall pride, then any Chriſtian zeale, to be too tetricall and rough in vrging men ſo farre, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in euery point is not ſo ſtrict and preciſe as our ſelues, we caſt them off as dogges and prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſuch as are vnworthy of any account or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                  <p>The next propertie of true zeale,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> is, not to be blinded with naturall affection,
<note place="margin">Zeale con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth ſin in friends as vvel as in foes. Mat. 16.23. Gal. 3.1. 1. Cor.</note> but to diſcerne and condemne ſinne, euen in thoſe that are neereſt and deareſt vnto vs. That was it that made Chriſt ſo ſharply to rebuke <hi>Peter;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to deale ſo roundly with the <hi>Galathians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many offend againſt this rule, who will neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue ſinne in their friends, till God reuenge it from heauen; wherein they are farre from true friendſhip: for whereas they might by admoniſhing them of their faults in time, preuent the iudgements of God, they do, through a falſe loue, pull the wrath of God vpon them whom they loue moſt dearely. Hee loueth moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, that hath learned to loue ſpiritually: and hee loueth moſt ſincerely, that cannot abide ſinne in the partie beloued, without ſome wholeſome admonition.</p>
                  <p>But doe not manie now adayes ſeeme zealouſlie to miſlike ſinne in ſtrangers, who can winke at the ſame fault in their kindred, in their wiues, in their children, in their parents? as if the diuerſitie of perſons could change the nature of the ſinne. This blind zeale God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150583:167"/>hath puniſhed, and doth puniſh his children. <hi>Iſaac</hi> did carnally loue his ſonne <hi>Eſau</hi> for meat, &amp; for a peece of veniſon.
<note place="margin">Gen. 15.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> was too much affected to <hi>Abſalon</hi> and to <hi>Adoniah</hi> for their comely perſonage, ſo as his zeale was hindered in diſcerning ſinne aright in them. Now <hi>Iacob</hi> was not ſo deare to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> was more hardly ſet to ſchoole, and made to take paines: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, God louing <hi>Iacob,</hi> and refuſing <hi>Eſau,</hi> (howſoeuer <hi>Iſaac</hi> loued <hi>Eſau</hi> better then <hi>Iacob</hi>) made <hi>Eſau</hi> more troubleſome, and <hi>Iacob</hi> more comfortable vnto him. <hi>Abſalon</hi> and <hi>Adoniah,</hi> brought vp like Cocknies, became coraſiues to <hi>Dauids</hi> heart: <hi>Salomon</hi> more reſtrained and better inſtructed, was his ioy, his crowne, his ſucceſſor in his kingdome. This diſeaſe is ſo hereditary to many parents, louing their children in the fleſh, rather then in the ſpirit, that the holy Ghoſt is faine to cal vpon them more vehemently, to teach, to inſtruct, and to correct, as knowing how eaſily nature would coole zeale in this kinde of dutie. Indeed many will ſet by their wiues, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and kinsfolkes, if they be thriftie, like to become good husbands, wittie and politicke, or if they be ſuch as for their gifts can bring ſome reuenue to their ſtocke, or affoord ſome profit vnto them; how deepe ſinners ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be againſt God, that maketh no matter, it little grieueth them: whereby they bewray their great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that they are neither zealous in truth of Gods glory, nor louers aright of their children, becauſe they can be ſharpe enough in reprehenſion if they faile but a little in thriftineſſe, and yet are too too cold in admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, if they faile neuer ſo much in godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Well, let theſe fleſhly zealous men lay to their heart the blinde affection of <hi>Heli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. &amp; 3. &amp; 4.</note> who being the deare childe of God, was ſeuerely puniſhed of the Lord, for that he was not zealouſly affected to puniſh the groſſe and foule offences of his children: but bleſſed are they that can forget their owne cauſe, and euen with icopardie of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150583:168"/>nature can defend the quarrel of God, labouring hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth to know no man after the fleſh, nor ſuffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward league ſo to bleare and dazle their eyes, as that they ſhould not eſpie ſinne in their deareſt friends to reforme it, or that they ſhould not diſcerne vertue in the greateſt aliens to reuerence it.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas many haue great courage to rebuke ſuch as either cannot gainſay them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
                     <note place="margin">Zeale oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſins of the mighty.</note> or gainſaying them, cannot preuaile againſt them, heere commeth another property of zeale to be ſpoken of, and that is, that it fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the face of the mightie, neither is it diſmaied at the lookes of the proud and loftie. Such was the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Iob,</hi> who beſides that he made the young men aſhamed of their liberty, &amp; afraide of his grauity, made euen the Princes alſo to ſtay their talke,
<note place="margin">Iob. 29.8.9.</note> and to lay their hands on their mouthes. And yet heere we muſt beware of their haſty zeale, who will not ſticke to charge the children of God to be without zeale, if preſently and abruptly they ruſh not into an open reprehenſion of men that are mightie in authoritie, as though no regard of time, place, or perſons were to be had: which opinion many by weakeneſſe of iudgement defending, find nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit in others, nor comfort in their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, when they doe admoniſh in that preſumptuous maner: for that hunting after feruentneſſe without the ſpirit of meekneſſe, and caſting off all conſideration of a godly opportunitie, they rather exaſperate then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the parties admoniſhed: and they themſelues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depart with confuſion and ſhame, for ſuch poſting on without warrant of wiſedome, then with comfort of heart for any duty done. Neither am I heere ignorant how great danger of trouble of minde commeth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in that they, being ſo curious obſeruers and waiters of opportunity, doe for ſome eaſe of the fleſh, vnder the cloake of this wiſedome, altogether leaue off that godly dutie. Wherefore, as we affirme that wiſedome
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150583:168"/>and loue mixed together do deeply enter into the moſt prefract &amp; prodigious ſpirits; ſo we miſlike their feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full delay of duty, who hauing a meane occaſion offered them from the Lord, doe not zealouſly and earneſtly rebuke ſinne, though in ſome higher perſonages.</p>
                  <p>Out of this may iſſue another frutit of holy zeale, namely when we are zealous in their behalfe who can neuer recompence vs againe, and that in defending their right againſt oppreſſors that are craftier &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier then they. Thus <hi>Iob deliuered the poore that cried,
<note place="margin">Iob. 29.12.</note> the fatherleſſe and him that had none to helpe him. He was the eyes to the blinde, and feet to the lame,</hi> at whoſe hands no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was to be looked for.</p>
                  <p>Another moſt excellent and glorious propertie of pure zeale is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
                     <note place="margin">Compaſſion to be ioyned vvith zeale.</note> to be humbled in our ſelues for thoſe ſins which we eſpie and cenſure in others, and ſo to nouriſh an holy compaſſion towards them.</p>
                  <p>Heere is an excellent and infallible difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene godly zeale and fleſhly heat, viz. when our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for our brothers falling doth not feed it ſelf vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the party, becauſe of our wrath, but vpon his ſinne, becauſe of our zeale; we ſtill retaining a tender affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perſon of the offender. When our Sauiour Chriſt went about to heale the man that had the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hand, the <hi>Phariſes</hi> that ſtood by murmured, becauſe hee would heale on the Sabbath day: herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is ſaid, that he looked about him angerlie, &amp; yet it is added, that he ſorrowed for the hardnes of their harts. Marke here in this notable example,
<note place="margin">Mark. 3.5.</note> how anger and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row meete together: Anger, that men ſhould haue ſo little knowledge of God, and loue of ther brother:
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.37. Luk. 19.41.42.</note> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that through ignorance they were ſo foulie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene. So likewiſe in zeale of his father, Chriſt looked on <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> with an hatred to their ſinne, and yet with pittie of their miſerie which was at hand, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150583:169"/>in that he wept ouer it.</p>
                  <p>Marke this in all the Prophets from time to time, as in <hi>Iſay, Ieremie, Ezekicl, Daniel, &amp;c:</hi> whether they did not vtter their meſſage in heauineſſe of ſpirit: and when they moſt threatned the people for their ſinnes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue if they were not moſt grieued and feared, leaſt they ſhould be executed vpon them. This is a bleſſed temperature, thus to mingle griefe with zeale: but that is an ouer-reaching zeale, that feedeth more on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then on the ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore wee muſt craue this ſpeciall grace at the hand of God by prayer, to be gouerned by a right zeale, and that we may trulie diſcerne the difference betweene fretting anger, and pining zeale. Which if all ſorts of men would labour for, receiuing this rule in iudgement, and obſeruing it in practiſe, it would breede a great deale more conſcience in miniſters, magiſtrates, and maſters, when they are to admoniſh their inferiours. Alas wee ſee manie, who can mangle and martyr a man for ſome offence, who neuer learned for conſcience ſake to mourne for thoſe infirmities, which ſo bitterly they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt in others. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temper:
<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.21. 1. Cor. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>I feare</hi> (ſaith he) to the <hi>Corinthians, leſt when I come, my God abaſe mee among you, and I ſhall bewaile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, which haue ſinned already, &amp;c:</hi> he <hi>knew nothing by himſelfe,</hi> (as hee telleth them in another place) yet could he not but lament and be humbled for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, who were a part of his Apoſtolike charge. So <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the zeale of Gods glorie, ſpares not flatly to tell <hi>Saul</hi> of his ſinne, notwithſtanding his great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.35.</note> and yet in loue and compaſſion to his perſon, hee was alwayes bent to lament <hi>Sauls</hi> caſe, and earneſtly to pray for him, till the Lord forbad him to doe ſo anie longer. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1.</p>
                  <p>If wee could keepe this golden mixture, wee ſhould ſtop the mouthes of the aduerſaries, who accuſe vs to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150583:169"/>full of rancour and malice, if wee be angrie as enemies to their ſinne, but grieued in that for ſinne they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enemies to God.</p>
                  <p>Further, wee muſt know,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that true zeale maketh vs as willing to be admoniſhed, as carefull to admoniſh:
<note place="margin">True zeale maketh men deſirous of admonition.</note> and that not only of our ſuperiours, which is an eaſie thing, becauſe there wee muſt of neceſſitie yeeld: but alſo of our inferiours, whom we may ſeeme to contemne. All men will graunt, that a childe ought willingly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of his father, or a ſeruant of his maiſter: but fewe will in practiſe giue this, that a father ſhould liſten to the aduertiſement of his ſonne, or that a maiſter ſhould receiue an admonition of his ſeruant. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, hee durſt not contemne the iudgement of his ſeruant or of his maide,
<note place="margin">Iob. 30.13.</note> when they did contend with him, becauſe in a dutie of pietie, he looked to them, not as ſeruants, but as brethren; he looked not to the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker onely, which in reſpect of his calling was his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, but vnto the things ſpoken in the ordinance of God, vnto whom <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe was an inferiour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom he knew there was no reſpect of perſons.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit to correct the prepoſterous boldneſſe of ſome, wee adde thus much, that inferiours muſt rather aduiſe than admoniſh: aduertiſe rather then reprehend their ſuperiours, that ſo ſtill they may offer their pure zeale of the glorie of God in vnfained humilitie, leſt through their corrupt zeale, they do not only not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit their ſuperiours, but moſt iuſtly exaſperate them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                  <p>Another rule is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> that in pure zeale wee be patient in our owne cauſes, &amp; deuoure many priuate iniuries;
<note place="margin">Wee muſt be moſt feruent in Gods cauſes</note> but hote and feruent in Gods cauſes. Manie can be as hote as fire in their owne priuate matters, who are as colde as ice in things that concerne Gods honor and glorie.</p>
                  <p>But it was otherwiſe with <hi>Moſes:</hi> When anie priuate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150583:170"/>wrong was offered vnto him by the Iſraelites, he was meeke as a lambe, and would with wiſedome ſpeake mildly vnto them to pacifie them, and pray earneſtly vnto God to pardon them: but when they fell to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and worſhipped the golden calfe, (a matter which neerely concerned the glory of God) <hi>his wrath waxed hot,
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.19.20.</note> and he caſt the tables out of his hands, and brake them in peeces, and burnt the calfe in the fire, and ground it to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and made them drinke of it, being ſtrewed vpon the water;</hi> and after cauſed a great number of the principall doers in this wickedneſſe to be ſlaine by the ſword. This alſo is the commendation of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that they had much patience, and yet <hi>could not forbeare thoſe which were euill,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 2.2.</note> but examined them which ſaid they were Apostles, and found them liars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rule well obſerued, would ſow vp the lips of the aduerſaries, who though for a time they thinke vs to be cholloricke, and men out of our wits, madly reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our priuate affections, yet one day they ſhould confeſſe, that we ſought not our owne commoditie, but Gods moſt precious glory.</p>
                  <p>And to ſtretch this examination of our hearts one degree further, let vs beware of that corruption, which, ſpringing from ſelfe-loue, will giue vs leaue to reioyce in good things, ſo long as they be in our ſelues, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineth at the ſight of them in others: which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vs to be grieued at euill things in our ſelues, and yet make vs to reioyce to ſee the ſame in others.</p>
                  <p>True zeale (hauing Gods glory for the obiect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) loueth good whereſoeuer, and in whomſoeuer it is: true zeale hateth ſinne whereſoeuer and in whomſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. True zeale loueth friends as they be Gods friends: true zeale hateth aduerſaries, ſo farre as they be Gods aduerſaries: true zeale loueth a good thing in the moſt profeſſed enemie: true zeale hateth ſinne in the moſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150583:170"/>aſſured friend.</p>
                  <p>If wee be perſwaded that our enemies bee Gods children, howſoeuer wee diſagree in ſome particulars, yet wee muſt ſwallow vp manie priuate iniuries, and more reioice in them as they be Gods ſeruants, then be grieued at them, as they haue iniuried vs.</p>
                  <p>Indeed true Zeale is moſt grieued at the ſinnes of the godly, becauſe ſo much are their ſinnes more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous then the ſinnes of others, by how much they came neerer to the image of God then others.</p>
                  <p>The laſt rule is,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> that wee keepe a tenour of zeale in both eſtates, to wit, of proſperitie and aduerſitie.
<note place="margin">Zeale muſt be conſtant in all eſtates.</note> Wee muſt eſpeciallie looke to that whereunto wee are moſt readie, that is, whether wee be more zealous in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and fall away in aduerſitie; or whether we be more feruent in affliction, and ouer-whelmed in abundance: whether by the one we are not puffed vp with ſecuritie and ſecret pride, and whether by the other we be not too farre abaſed and diſcouraged; or, which is worſt of all, quite driuen out of the way: for many in time of peace are religious, who ſeeing perſecution to follow the Goſpell,
<note place="margin">Luke. 8.13.</note> begin (like thoſe that are compared to ſtonie ground) top ſtep backe, and at laſt vtterly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their former profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Others ſo long as they may haue credit by embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Goſpell, will ſeeme to goe farre; but when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit comes, they forſake all: contrarie to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.61. Verſe. 161.</note> 
                     <hi>The bandes of the wicked haue robbed mee, yet haue I not forgotten thy Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And againe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Princes did perſecute mee without cauſe,
<note place="margin">Verſe 141.</note> but mine heart ſtood in awe of thy Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for diſgrace hee ſaith,</p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:150583:171"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>I am ſmall and deſpiſed,
<note place="margin">Verſe. 141.</note> yet doe I not forget thy Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others on the contrary part, ſo long as God exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them with any croſſe, are zealous profeſſours, who beeing ſet aloſt, and comming once vnto promotion, begin to grow ſecure and carefleſſe of all duties towards God or men, as is to be ſeene in the Iſraelites from time to time.</p>
                  <p>We ſee manie in time of their miſerie to bee much humbled;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.34. &amp;c. Iudger.</note> and whiles they want liuings and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ſee both Preachers and people in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance very godlie, who hauing obtained that which they ſought for, haue their zeale vtterly choked.</p>
                  <p>Doe not many pray for the continuance of the peace of the Goſpell, that they themſelues might continue in peace and proſperitie? Doe not manie mourne in the aduerſitie of the Goſpell, becauſe they are grieued for their owne aduerſitie! Oh great corruption of our hearts! Oh bottomles pit of hypocriſie! If wee were aſhamed that wee are no more grounded on the word, and that wee can bee no nore holie and vpright in our hearts, ſurely the Lord will ſo gouerne vs, that he would not ſuffer either proſperitie to quench our zeale, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie to diſcourage our hearts.</p>
                  <p>This is then our triall herein, if when we are in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt proſperitie, we can mourne with them that mourne in the Lorde; and when wee are in greateſt aduerſitie, wee can reioyce with them that reioyce in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſure token wee loue not the Goſpell, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the word, becauſe wee haue a loue to proſperitie, neither are zealous to ſee the word contemned, becauſe wee haue an hatred of aduerſitie. <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning outward things was an happie man, as being neere to the Crowne: and yet when hee ſaw the God of <hi>Iſraels</hi> glory to be defaced, and his ſeruants and ſeruices to be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:150583:171"/>trodden vnder foote, hee could content himſelfe with nothing ſo much, as with faſting, weeping, and prayer.
<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> on the other ſide being in bonds for the teſtimonie of Ieſus Chriſt, and concerning his outward man in a miſerable caſe, reioyced greatly, and was as it were reuiued when he heard that the Goſpell flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and that the faith and loue of the Saints was ſtill continued.
